# **About** 

Hello, my name is Shane Crowley and I created [edibotopic.com](https://edibotopic.github.io/edibotopic-website) primarily to [write about](/blog/) ideas in the technology, design and philosophy of food. Finding new ways to think about food and nutrition is especially interesting to me, and as an academic at University College Cork (Ireland) my teaching and research mostly focuses on food science and technology.

I also regularly experiment with creative [projects](/projects/), especially in [music](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/) and [programming](https://github.com/edibotopic), the results of which will be posted here occasionally. 

A number of articles are in preparation for [edibotopic.com](https://edibotopic.github.io/edibotopic-website), but they take time to finalise in between other work. The website is also in the process of being [migrated](/posts/000-site-migrated) from another platform and will take some time to re-populate with content. I hope you find something interesting here in the meantime.
