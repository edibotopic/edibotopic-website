All my music is available *for free* on my [Bandcamp page](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/) and is free to use in your projects (attributions appreciated).

## Software

[Stoke's Law](https://edibotopic.github.io/stokes-law/) | April 2023

*Animated simulation of Stoke's law, a mathematical equation used commonly in food science to explain separation phenomena*

[Write Height](https://edibotopic.github.io/write-height/) | January 2022

*An easy-to-use application for converting 2D grayscale images to 3D models that can be downloaded in various file formats*

All my software projects are free and open-source. They can be found on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/edibotopic).

## Philosophy

[Book chapter on metaphors in food technology](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003143567-5/alchemical-cyborgian-imaginings-technoscientific-discourse-relating-holistic-turns-food-processing-personalised-nutrition-shane-crowley) | July 2021

*Wide-ranging article, drawing from many disciplines, exploring the role of metaphor in discourse around food science and technology*

Currently I have several works in the following *general* areas that I am seeking to publish:

- Formal methods in food technology
- Ontological discourse in food and nutrition

## Science

My scientific work to date has mainly focused on the following topics:

- *Food structure and function*: the impact of micro- and macro-scale properties on the techno-functional behaviour of food and ingredients (e.g., dissolution, flow) 
- *Food design and formulation*: the rational design of multi-component food systems for use in specific applications (e.g., sports nutrition, meal-replacement)
- *Food processing and fractionation*: the development of novel processing strategies to create new ingredients and products (e.g., 3D-printed food, bio-functional proteins)

The most up-to-date lists of my publications can be found on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aw1EnaIAAAAJ&hl=en) or [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Shane-Crowley)
