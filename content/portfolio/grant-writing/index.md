{% tip(title="My role in writing grant proposals") %} 
The extent of my responsibilites ranged from coordinating the entire proposal,
including developing the idea, assembling a team and managing the budget, to
writing specific work packages.

The table below includes examples of successful grant proposals where I made a significant contribution.

I worked on many other proposals during my time in academia.
While a PhD student, I wrote an entire proposal for an MSc project on mineral processing over a weekend.
The proposal was successful although I went uncredited (common for PhD students 🤷).

Below is an example title page from a proposal I successfully coordinated, prior to my departure from academia:
