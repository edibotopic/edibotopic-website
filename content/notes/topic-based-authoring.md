Topic-based authoring is a writing approach that organizes content into self-contained topics.

Even if a topic is part of a larger collection, and is inter-related with other topics, it is
expected to stand alone. Someone should be able to read it in isolation from the other topics.

A primary advantage of this approach is reuse, in which content written using
topic-based authoring can be effectively combined in different ways. 

This is useful, for example, if there are two different products where a
certain topic is common to both. That topic can be written once and then used
in those two places.
