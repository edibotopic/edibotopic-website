Information mapping is a type of [structured
authoring](/notes/structured-authoring) developed by [Robert E.
Horn](/notes/robert-e-horn).

It is a system for identifying, categorizing, and connecting information in a
document. Originally, it was developed for learning-oriented references.

Documents organised using information mapping are often consistently ordered on
the page/screen, with each information type clearly identified by marginal
labels.
