Structured authoring is an approach to creating written content using
predefined structures and constraints. An early example of this was
[information mapping](/notes/information-mapping).

In [DITA](/notes/dita), the structure is enforced by the tooling.
[Diataxis](/notes/diataxis) is comparatively more tool-agnostic, with the
structure being adopted by a team as a shared practice. There is no reason why
DITA can't be used without specific tooling, or that specific tooling couldn't
be developed for Diataxis.
