Viscosity is a property of fluids that describes their resistance to flow and deformation. Higher viscosity means the fluid flows more slowly.

Examples:
- Water has low viscosity (flows easily)
- Honey has high viscosity (flows slowly)
- Motor oil has medium viscosity

Viscosity is a critical parameter in Stokes' Law, affecting how quickly particles settle in a liquid. Higher viscosity slows particle sedimentation.
