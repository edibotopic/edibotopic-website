An approach to technical documentation that divides content into four types:

* Howto
* Tutorial
* Reference
* Explanation

These are further grouped in two ways:

* Whether a skill is being acquired or applied
* Whether the user is doing or thinking

For example:

* Tutorials help people learn new skills through doing
* References provide information to help people apply their skills
