A page for quick notes,
often committed from my phone.

When my family first got a computer in the mid 90's it was a Packard Bell that had this alternative environment for navigating the system. It was essentially a Myst-like set in a family home with book shelves, fax machines and things of that nature. I remember my mother bringing me to her friend's house, which was bigger than ours and had a newer Packard Bell with an even fancier pseudo-3D navigator.
