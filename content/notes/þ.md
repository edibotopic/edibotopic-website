When making anything there is the doing and the reward.
To stay motivated you nearly always need to love doing the thing, then you can do without external reward, by which I mean status or compensation.
If you find the absence of external reward troubling then consider reward in a broader sense: the possibility of reward; the reward in doing; the reward in learning; the reward in showing; the reward of the next thing...

There is no philosophy without arguments.

If an incoherent utterance is deemed to have merit or warrant scrutiny then somewhere a philosopher will endeavor to put it in standard form.

Then it can be determined if this and other occurrences, natural and artificial, are valid, or at the very least forceful.

It seems there will always be philosophy because philosophers find arguments even where none are apparent to the rest of us.

This is except when they stipulate otherwise, like Popper in his analysis of science, where he decided that the process of discovery was a matter for the psychologists.

To do something intelligible that resists philosophical interpretation is but an act of provoking a philosopher's stipulatory demarcation.

Even then, there is still philosophy happening.

Ideas viewed as transformational often amount to a renewed focus on the concept of a loop, whence the rationalists start conjuring images of yinyang and ouroborus as if there is some ancient metaphysics behind their funding proposal.

When my family first got a computer in the mid 90's it was a Packard Bell that had this alternative environment for navigating the system. It was essentially a Myst-like set in a family home with book shelves, fax machines and things of that nature. I remember my mother bringing me to her friend's house, which was bigger than ours and had a newer Packard Bell with an even fancier pseudo-3D navigator.
