_September 22nd_

When I started helping my brother paint houses it struck me how unfamiliar I was with the names for things I saw every day, like plinth, architrave, and coving.

When you've had an interesting experience there's a question as to whether it needs to be communicated.

It could be so common as to be mundane and people might question why you bothered saying anything at all.

Sometimes it will be so uncommon that people will find it strange to hear.

The special case is when you refer to a common experience that is otherwise referred to uncommonly. This can be confused with the mundane or the strange but when expressed the right way its impact can be significant.

Reading Mrs Dalloway...

> Rigid, the skeleton of habit alone upholds the human frame.

> [...] like something alive which wants to confide itself [...]

Authoratively poetic.

When I supervised younger scientists, I would often find myself saying things like:

_A "tripling" in the measurable redness of milk is unlikely to be meaningful or interesting._

I'm not a numbers person. I use them when necessary. You typically won't hear me complain about levels of mathematical literacy. I once read a book about innumeracy that had lots of clever examples, many of which I didn't encounter in the world. The above example, however, is something that I think causes mass confusion and delusion on a regular basis. Let's call it:

**Misleading ratios**. Maybe there is a fancy name for this but I could not find it.

It goes something like...

_Last year there was one sighting of a person with blue face paint in our supermarkets. This year the number has grown two-fold. That's a 100% increase!_

Of course, it's still a really small number of blue-faced people: two. Supermarkets are not overwhelmed. Cashiers do not need special training for the tricky task of age-verifying beer-buyers with blue face paint. Politicians do not need to start reminiscing publicly about how the country used to be before its citizens began painting their faces blue.

There could be one person who consistently paints their face blue every day. That's a small number that could still be meaningful: why is that person doing that? It could be an interesting story. If one year a second person tries it out on a whim then that two-fold increase is likely meaningless. It's neither a big nor stable change in the context of a town or city. Wait until you see a trend across multiple years; even then, check whether there are worthwhile causes and/or consequences relating to the trend you are reporting.

People are frequently over-excited by scientific results, crime statistics and business metrics where some kind of Hollywood ratio has been deployed.

"This area of the brain normally has vanishingly small levels of activity but our treatment saw a three-fold increase."

"Crime has been declining steadily for fifteen years but last year saw a doubling from the previous year's historic low, causing major concern."

"Sales for this product have been effectively zero for six years but they quadrupled in the last quarter."

This misleading use of ratios is everywhere. It is an infinitely renewable resource for toxic politics. In science it is sometimes given a false legitimacy by the assignment of a p-value. It is a most routine feature of data rhetoric, or persuasion by numbers, manipulating our emotions while teaching us nothing.

A good conversation has interruptions.
It's one of the things that makes in-real-life conversations distinct from those by email or chat app. We interrupt for different reasons: an awareness that we have deviated from the main topic; an identification of something critical that has been expressed in the moment; an attempt to halt progress towards something unproductive or harmful. It is a common occurrence that your interlocutor will intuit what you are trying to say while you are struggling to say it. Friends interrupt all the time. I love being interrupted. It nearly always clarifies my thinking. For some there is an apparent desire to have conversations without interruption. Everyone speaks in order. Hands are raised. People wait their turn. These types of conversations can be joyless and slow. It is only necessary when a group exceeds a certain size. One of the advantages of meetings with smaller numbers of people is that it facilitates interruption, as long as people interrupt in good spirit. When a powerful individual attends, the manner and force with which they interrupt can have a different quality. This is a separate matter entirely.

---

The interruption dynamic in chat apps is unique and interesting. There is an indicator that someone is typing that is potentially interruptive or that can prompt interruption. Maybe you are both typing at the same time. Anticipating a misinterpretation of what you previously typed you may now try to clarify, or noticing a particularly long typing indicator duration you might query if the message is going to be _serious_, or expecting them to offer a joke or insight you might try to get there first. You type something and interrupt their typing, their typing indicator stops and you hope it starts again, then relief when it quickly does! In a group chat a known malevolent actor begins typing... Some plan to defuse the emergent situation, others observe silently and some remove themselves completely.

During my time in academia there was once a heated university-wide debate about academic titles. At issue was whether our university should change our titles to be more like other Irish universities who use North American-style titles. One of our Lecturers might be called an Assistant Professor somewhere else; some argued that the latter was more "important sounding" and could therefore be more competitive in a funding proposal; perhaps they might command more respect at a formal event. Lecturer, however, was a tenured position, unlike Assistant Professor in the North American sense, who is typically pre-tenure. Also, neither Lecturers nor Assistant Professors are assistants to anyone in particular; an academic position is characteristically independent of such hierarchical impositions. These concerns were dismissed as unimportant by Associate Professors who themselves wanted to be known by the more impressive Full Professor. Some people expressed vague, mystical reverence for the title of Professor, wanting it only for a tiny minority. Few were interested in using titles that fit the actual role. Just at the level of language, what differentiates one who professes from one who lectures? How from these titles might a member of the public discern that these academics spend an inordinate amount of time doing research and not teaching?? It was mostly about people wanting nicer-sounding titles, right? At least that was my judgement in the absence of any evidence being presented concerning the relation between academic title and success in funding acquisition. I engaged in the debate to a degree but stopped when I thought to myself "what would any reasonable tax-paying person who does not work in a university think about this ridiculous conversation?". Frivolous and embarassing, it probably continues.

Currently this website has blogs, notes, projects and whatever these are (sub-notes? logs??). I think the blog posts should be relatively complete, to the point of my being comfortable with calling them "articles". For example, they shouldn't include things like "hey I just made some beats, preview at the embed". I'm never satisfied with those announcements and should just use the projects page to record the titles and links.

Testing making and commiting images from phone. A little bit cumbersome, not impossible, and of unclear value, but it works.

_September 10th_

When making anything there is the doing and the reward.
To stay motivated you nearly always need to love doing the thing, then you can do without external reward, by which I mean status or compensation.
If you find the absence of external reward troubling then consider reward in a broader sense: the possibility of reward; the reward in doing; the reward in learning; the reward in showing; the reward of the next thing...

There is no philosophy without arguments.

If an incoherent utterance is deemed to have merit or warrant scrutiny then somewhere a philosopher will endeavor to put it in standard form.

Then it can be determined if this and other occurrences, natural and artificial, are valid, or at the very least forceful.

It seems there will always be philosophy because philosophers find arguments even where none are apparent to the rest of us.

This is except when they stipulate otherwise, like Popper in his analysis of science, where he decided that the process of discovery was a matter for the psychologists.

To do something intelligible that resists philosophical interpretation is but an act of provoking a philosopher's stipulatory demarcation.

Even then, there is still philosophy happening.

Ideas viewed as transformational often amount to a renewed focus on the concept of a loop, whence the rationalists start conjuring images of yinyang and ouroborus as if there is some ancient metaphysics behind their funding proposal.

_September 8th_

When my family first got a computer in the mid 90's it was a Packard Bell that had this alternative environment for navigating the system. It was essentially a Myst-like set in a family home with book shelves, fax machines and things of that nature. I remember my mother bringing me to her friend's house, which was bigger than ours and had a newer Packard Bell with an even fancier pseudo-3D navigator.
