Homogenisation is a mechanical process that reduces the size of particles or droplets in a mixture to create a more uniform, stable product.

Common application: Milk homogenisation
- Breaks down fat globules into smaller droplets
- Prevents cream separation
- Creates consistent texture and appearance

By reducing particle size, homogenisation slows sedimentation rates (as described by Stokes' Law), thereby increasing product stability and shelf life.
