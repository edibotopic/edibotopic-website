Tutorialization is the intentional practice of designing a section or level of
a game so that it teaches the player to play the game.

A tutorial may be designed in such a way that the player doesn't know they are
following a tutorial.

Some argue that a sufficiently well-designed game does not require
tutorialization, because the player should intuitively discover how to play the
game. Similar arguments are made about design in general (i.e., the ideal
flatpack desk does not require a manual to build as it teaches you how to build
it).
