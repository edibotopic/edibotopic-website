Systemism is an epistemology that attempts to achieve a fusion between holism and reductionism.

This encompasses two kinds of *reduction*:

- Macro-reduction: from parts to wholes
- Micro-reduction: from wholes to parts

Having observed some interesting phenomenon in the world there is an attempt to identify the mechanism that caused it (micro-reduction). Equipped with this new understanding a model of the phenomenon can be constructed (macro-reduction).

Crucially, the initial naive observation — a human experience — is not destroyed or undermined in this process. It may remain sufficient for many people, and may be enriched for those who have obtained the new knowledge.
