# Dispersed System

Common focus of attention in sciences dealing with
colloids, such as the food, pharmaceutical and
cosmetic sciences.

A dispersion of one physical material in another,
resulting in a discrete set of particles disconnected
from themselves but connected at all points to a 
continuous phase.

Examples include:

- Emulsions (liquid dispersed in liquid)
- Solid foams (gas dispersed in solid)
- Suspensions (solid dispersed in liquid)
