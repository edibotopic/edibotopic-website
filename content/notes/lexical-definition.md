A lexical definition is the type of definition found in dictionaries, describing the conventional or common usage of a word.

Example (Merriam-Webster definition of "micelle"):
> Unit of structure built up from polymeric molecules or ions

Limitations:
- Provides basic conventional meaning but may lack precision for specialized contexts
- Expert usage often goes beyond or deviates from dictionary definitions
- May be insufficient for technical or domain-specific work
