A generalisation is a statement about a class.

The generalisation applies to instances of that class.

## Generalisation and ambiguity

Both ambiguity and generalisation involve one-to-many relationships:

* **Ambiguity**: one perception with many possible interpretations
* **Generalisation**: one class with many possible instances

The distinction is that the interpretations in a case of ambiguity are mutually independent, whereas the instances in a generalisation are members of some class.

A generalisation assumes some model that explains the class and its membership. Without an understanding of the model, a generalisation may have the appearance of an ambiguity.
