Emulsions are mixtures of two immiscible liquids (typically oil and water) where one liquid is dispersed as droplets throughout the other.

Common examples:
- Milk (fat droplets in water)
- Mayonnaise (oil droplets in water with egg as emulsifier)
- Creams and lotions

Emulsions are typically unstable and require emulsifiers (surfactants) to prevent the droplets from coalescing and separating.
