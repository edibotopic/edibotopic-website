A vertical slice is a demo of a game's major features, without being an
exhaustive account.

The introductory chapter or level may only be a limited showcase of the game.

The vertical slice may combine aspects of early-, mid-, and late-game, so that
reviewers develop a more full picture of the game's design.

An opening of a game may itself be a kind of vertical slice, providing the player
with a glimpse of the game's possibilities and compelling them forward.

Outside of games, a tutorial may function as a kind of vertical slice.
