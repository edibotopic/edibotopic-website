Endophoric ambiguity occurs when a reference within a text could refer to multiple independent parts of that same text.

Example: "From the example above..." when there are multiple preceding examples
- Which specific example is being referenced?

This type of ambiguity is common in technical writing and can be resolved through more specific references (e.g., "From Example 2.3..." or "As shown in the previous section...").
