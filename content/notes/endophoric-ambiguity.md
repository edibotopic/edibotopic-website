Endophoric ambiguity occurs when a reference within a text could refer to multiple independent parts of that same text.

Example: "From the example above..." when there are multiple preceding examples:

_Which specific example is being referenced?_

This type of ambiguity is common in technical writing and can be resolved through more specific references (e.g., "From Example 2.3...", "In the `hello.go` example snippet.").
