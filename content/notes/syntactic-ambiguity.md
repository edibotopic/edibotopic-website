Syntactic ambiguity occurs when the structure of a sentence allows for multiple interpretations.

Example: "The program loads files from the server during startup":

_Does "during startup" refer to the program's startup, the server's startup, or both?_

Unlike lexical ambiguity (word meanings), syntactic ambiguity arises from how words are arranged and related to each other in a sentence.
