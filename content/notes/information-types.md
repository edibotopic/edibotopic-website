## Overview

Some frameworks for information architecture and technical documentation use types.

Using types can help ensure that the organisation of information is more
effective, structured, and consistent.

Two popular approaches for technical documentation are [DITA](/notes/dita) and
[Diataxis](/notes/diataxis).

## Comparing frameworks

Three of the core information types for both are broadly equivalent:

| Core DITA types       | Equivalent Diataxis types   | Description              |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Task                  | How-to                      | Goal-oriented guides     |
| Concept               | Explanation                 | Explanations of concepts |
| Reference             | Reference                   | Factual references       |

Diataxis also prominently features a fourth type: the tutorial.
However, the learning-focused tutorial is approximated by the specialised Learning & Training topic in DITA.
Indeed, DITA can be extended with additional types, while Diataxis is a fixed four-type system:

| Extra DITA types      | Equivalent Diataxis types   | Description                                  |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Troubleshooting       | How-to                      | Goal-oriented tasks with a corrective goal   |
| Glossary              | Reference                   | Collection of terms included in a reference  |
| Learning & Training   | Tutorial                    | A guided learning experience                 |
