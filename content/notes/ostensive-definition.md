An ostensive definition is a way of defining a term by pointing to or showing examples of what the term refers to.

Examples:
- Pointing at an object and saying "That is an architrave"
- Showing someone what "red" means by pointing to red objects
- Defining "robust code" by pointing to an exemplary codebase

Limitations:
- Cannot define abstract or invisible concepts
- May not convey full understanding needed for complex tasks
- Understanding depends on shared context between definer and learner
