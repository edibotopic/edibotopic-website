If you've ever pursued an interest, you've probably been told that your
interests aren't interesting, or at least not worthwhile:

"Yeah, that's interesting, but..."

<!-- more -->

{% note(title="Draft") %} 
This is an early draft.

When you have tried and failed to be interesting in a conversation, it
can sometimes be signalled by the response:

"That's interesting..."

Finding and exploring interesting ideas is often associated with a child-like
naivety:

"Look, we can't all just work on what interests us..."

There is a notion that being interesting is not sufficient for something to be
valuable:

"While the submission is interesting, it lacks..."
"The movie has a lot of interesting ideas, but it's an incoherent mess."

In pursuit of value, we may even dispense with interestingess altogether, and opt
for tried-and-tested solutions, which are characteristically uninteresting.

There are things that I value that I don't want to be interesting, like the orange
juice I drink every morning.

## Becoming interested

It would be a historical tragedy if dogmatism and censorship meant that
Gallileo's ideas had never become widely known.  It would be just as much of a
tragedy if Gallileo had simply never become interested in physics.  I'm just as
fearful of a world in which we lose the capacity to become interested, as I am
of a world of censorship.

## Salience and remarkability

One sense, is that an interesting thing is salient.  It stands out from the
background and can be recognised. This doesn't seem right, as there are lots of
things that we can distinguish in our surroundings that are not interesting. At
a minimum, interestingness has a shelf-life: that which was interesting to a
child remains salient but gradually becomes commonplace.

By interesting, we can mean instead remarkable, literally: worth remarking on.
I can distinguish a pencil on my desk, but that doesn't warrant a blogpost or
conversation. For me to say "I want to talk about X on my desk", it cannot only
be salient, unless we mean salient in some heightened sense. Interestingess is
something that generates deliberate activity: focus, exploration, invention.

In addition to salience, perhaps the interesting object:

- Has just now been recognised as valuable ("maybe we can use it to pick that lock")
- Has stimulated an idea, memory, or emotion ("I recall the pencils of my youth")

These examples seem indirect. It is not the pencil itself that is interesting. A
writer or psychologist might say that what is really interesting here is the
memory, or the fact that mundane objects can stimulate memory recall. An
important role for such professionals is helping us identify what is interesting
and what is merely incidental.

A final example is that in addition to salience, maybe it:

- Is surprising, unexpected, or novel (this was no ordinary pencil)

This suggests that something interesting must stand out from the general class
of things of which it is a particular instance. There are degrees of salience.
Apples are salient with respect to the apple tree. A ripe apple is salient with
respect to unripe apples. A cubic apple is salient with respect to spherical
apples. Which of these is most interesting?

The cubic apple might be generative of interesting questions:

- Logistically: could we leverage a cubic variety to transport apples more efficiently?
- Scientifically: why did some apples evolve to be cubes rather than spheres?
- Creatively: what happens when our main character time-travels to a future with cubic apples?

## Concealement and elusiveness

The idea of interestingness as salience is most compelling in cases of hidden
salience.  Think of the scientist who is the first to distinguish a new particle
or organism, or consider the valuable artifact found buried in the ground. In
these cases, something that is not immediately salient is made salient.  On this
account, something becomes interesting through the process of its uncovering, at
least partially.

In another sense, interestingness is a kind of rational attraction.  An
interesting thing is that which I am drawn to.  I keep returning to it, by
thinking, writing, or speaking about it. Yet, interestingess is subjective and
context-dependent.  What's interesting to me may not be interesting to you. What
is interesting to an academic may not be interesting to the CEO.

## Curiosity and motivation

The state of being interested is pleasant but also motivating.  A new or
important idea must always begin with someone being interested.  Becoming
interested is often a necessary component of discovery.  It is difficult to
compel someone to learn, if they are not interested. A disinterested scientist
might publish many papers, but they are unlikely to be celebrated.

Some people are said to be curious, and curious people tend to become
interested.  Curiosity is sometimes conceived of as a kind of skill.  People
will say "I can become interested in anything".  This seems associated with
traits of oppenness and determination.  Even then, someone like this usually has
their limits, and what they spend their time on can fall into a general class of
interesting activity, such as puzzle-solving.
