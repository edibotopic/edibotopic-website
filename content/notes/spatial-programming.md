# Spatial Programming

Designing computer programs in which rules written in a _spatial
programming language_ in some sense **resemble** the 
programmatic output that they will generate.

Most programs are written using collections of *symbols*.
These function as abstract signifiers that do not in any sense
*resemble* the output that they will generate.
They are interpreted according to *convention*.

Spatial programs instead use *icons*, signifiers that are *similar*
to the things that they are intended to signify and produce.

A symbolic program could be written such that `circle()`
is a function that generates a circular geometry on the screen.
Alternatively, a spatial program might allow us to type `O`,
with this character clearly being circular in form.

The output is not necessarily visual.
For example, in a music program `O` could represent an audio loop.
In this case, we would be using a spatial metaphor, where the
sound "goes around in a circle" and "returns to a start position".

In some applications, the term "spatial programming" may offer more 
clarity than related concepts like "graphical" or "visual" programming.
Most programming environments are *visual*, regardless of the nature of the
signifiers.
Similarly, "graphical" could refer to characters, pictures
or icons, as all are still rendered on a graphical interface.
Spatial — or *iconic* — programming highlights the distinction of
there being a salient resemblance between input and output. 
These icons could be depicted as characters in a text editor or as 
draggable pictures on an interactive canvas, as long as they are 
similar to what they generate.
