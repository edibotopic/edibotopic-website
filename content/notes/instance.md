## Overview

An instance is a concrete, individual manifestation of a class. In everyday
language, it means a true member of a group (an apple is a fruit).

To verb _to instance_, common in software engineering, means to actively create
something in accordance with its class. This could mean, for example.
instantiating a software object with data and functionality (object-oriented
programming) or instantiating a remote resource (cloud provisioning).

An apple tree could be said to _instance members of the fruit class_ but nobody
talks that way.

## Instances in generalisation

A generalisation is a statement about a class that applies to all of its
instances. For example, the generalisation "all programming languages have
syntax" applies to all programming languages.
