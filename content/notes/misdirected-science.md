# Misdirected Science

A phenomenon in contemporary science in which scientists
engage in projects derived from a scientific idea or hypothesis
that goes untested or unchallenged.
The interestingness or usefulness of the projects themselves is
entirely contingent on the validity of the idea from which they
were derived.

Often the original idea is interesting but unlikely, and has
attracted significant attention among non-scientists, resulting
in an abundant amount of funding being made available for research
in the area.

If the original idea is subsequently confirmed to be false, then the
entire edifice constructed around it will collapse, possibly
contributing to skepticism being directed towards science itself.
