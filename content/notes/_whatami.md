# What Am I?

These [notes](@/notes/_index.md) are a place for short, descriptive writing on
concepts, tools and works that I find interesting.
It is a "living document" and the entries will evolve over time.

If you find that something appears incomplete _that is normal_. I do
hope to revise the entries for completeness and correctness but this will
take time.
By then, some of the notes may have become a [blog post](@/blog/_index.md).

I have just added the notes section to my site so it will take time to populate.
