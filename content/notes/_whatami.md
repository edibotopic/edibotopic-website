These [notes](@/notes/_index.md) are a place for quickly recording any
concepts, tools or project that I find interesting or useful. It is a "living
document" and the entries will evolve over time.

By their nature the entries are incomplete. I do hope to revise them for
completeness and correctness but there are no guarantees. Some may one
day become a [blog post](@/blog/_index.md).

The notes section is a recent addition to this site, so it is sparsely
populated.
