These [notes](@/notes/_index.md) are for short, incomplete pieces of writing on
concepts, tools or project that I find interesting or useful.

The notes can be searched and there is automatic back-linking
to create inter-connections between them.

I hope to one day structure the site so that most of my writing goes here and
only the more full-realised writing goes in the [blog](@/blog/_index.md).

At the top there are some pages that I update regularly, including:

- An almost-daily **log** of whatever I happen to be thinking about
- A table tracking my **reading** that I started in Summer 2024

These are preceded by a **__** because I didn't have time to do anything better.
