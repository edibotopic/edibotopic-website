Flocculation is the process by which fine particles suspended in a liquid aggregate together to form larger clusters (flocs).

Common applications:
- Water treatment: removes impurities by making small particles settle faster
- Wine making: clarifies wine by aggregating sediment
- Wastewater treatment: separates suspended solids

By increasing effective particle size, flocculation increases sedimentation rates according to Stokes' Law, enabling easier separation of particles from liquid.
