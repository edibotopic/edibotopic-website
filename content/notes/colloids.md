Colloids are mixtures in which microscopic particles of one substance are dispersed throughout another substance but remain suspended rather than dissolving.

Common examples:
- Milk (fat droplets in water)
- Fog (water droplets in air)
- Mayonnaise (oil droplets in water)
- Paint (solid pigments in liquid)

Unlike solutions, colloidal particles are large enough to scatter light (Tyndall effect) but small enough to remain suspended.
