Ambiguity occurs when language, statements, or situations can be understood in multiple ways.

Types include lexical, syntactic, semantic, and substrate ambiguity, each arising from different aspects of language structure and meaning.

Understanding ambiguity is crucial in philosophy of language, logic, and communication.
