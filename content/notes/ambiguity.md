A statement is ambiguous when it can be given two or
more unrelated interpretations.

## Ambiguity in natural language

Ambiguity extends beyond the domain of language,
but its most well-known varieties are linguistic:

* **Lexical**: due to a word having multiple meanings (polysemy)
* **Syntactic**: due to the arrangement of words having multiple meanings
* **Semantic**: due to an expression having multiple meanings
* **Endophoric**: due to a reference that could refer to multiple parts of a text

Some of these terms are closely related; for example, lexical ambiguity is a
type of semantic ambiguity and Semantic ambiguity may be an effect of syntactic
ambiguity.

## Ambiguity outside natural language

Ambiguity is not restricted to natural language.

A painting, button or equation can be ambiguous.

$$\frac{si\cancel{n} \ x}{\cancel{n}} = six = 6$$

In general, an ambiguity involves a one-to-many
relationship between something that is perceived
and the set of its possible interpretations.

Disambiguation is the process of reducing this one-to-many relationship to a
one-to-one relationship, between the what is perceived and its intended and/or
correct interpretation.

## Productive ambiguity

In many cases, ambiguity is bad.

An ambiguous instruction can be catastrophic when operating
machinery, performing a surgery, or preparing a meal from a
potentially toxic fish.

Ambiguity, however, can also be useful.

When a recipe prompts us to add salt "to taste",
it is ambiguous with respect to the quantity of salt.
Yet it also provides us with the agency to choose and
experiment with the quantity.

Movies with enigmatic endings can be frustrating but
they also arouse our curiosity and provoke discussion.

## Ambiguity and discovery

Even in a methodical discipline like science, ambiguity can be understood
as a necessary stage of that activity.

Any scientific discovery begins with an ambiguity --- a phenomenon that admits
of multiple possible interpretations.md. This prompts the scientist to seek the
interpretation that has the highest probability of being correct.

Great scientists seek out ambiguities with the same vigour as they do answers.


## Technological ambiguity

Technology can be ambiguous in different ways:

* **Functional**: multiple interpretations of _what it does_
* **Procedural**: multiple interpretations of _how to use it_
* **Mechanistic**: multiple interpretations of _how it works_

A technology may have multiple valid functions and different valid procedures
for its use. This may result in the perception of ambiguity for the user, even
if the design is intentional and useful. As one becomes skilled, the sense of
ambiguity may be replaced with a sense of possibility.

<!-- I was once gifted a waiter's corkscrew. This replaced my old corkscrew, which I -->
<!-- would screw into cork before forcefully pulling it out. I used the new -->
<!-- corkscrew in the same way for several weeks until someone told me I was using -->
<!-- it wrong. -->
<!---->
<!-- The corkscrew worked the right way and the wrong way. Two procedures, one more -->
<!-- ergonomic, but both effective. -->

## Natural ambiguity

Naturally-occurring things or events may be ambiguous.

While enzymes were classically considered to be substrate-specific,
it is now known that some enzymes exhibit substrate ambiguity.

The same phenomenon has also been observed for molecular chaperones.

## Semiotic ambiguity

Natural signs may be ambiguous. A classic example is
smoke in the distance, which can be interpreted as an indicator
of fire but also the presence of humans.

The smoke may have been caused by lightning igniting a dry log or
by the campfire of a hostile group who is coming to get you.

<!-- * Semantic ambiguity: a button that has multiple functions -->
<!-- * Syntactic ambiguity: an array of buttons with non-obvious order -->

## Ambiguity and generalisation

Both ambiguity and generalisation involve one-to-many relationships.

* **Ambiguity**: many possible interpretations
* **Generalisation**: many possible instances

The distinction is that the interpretations in a case of ambiguity ($A$)
are mutually independent, whereas the instances in a generalisation ($G$)
are members of some class.

$$A: a \rightarrow \\{x, y,..., z\\}$$

$$G: g \rightarrow C, \ C = \\{g_1, g_2,..., g_n\\}$$

A generalisation assumes some model that explains the class and its membership.

Without an understanding of the model, a generalisation may have the appearance
of an ambiguity.
