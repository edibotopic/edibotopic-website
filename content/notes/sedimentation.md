Sedimentation is the process by which solid particles suspended in a liquid settle to the bottom of a container due to gravity.

The rate of sedimentation depends on:
- Particle size (larger particles settle faster)
- Density difference between particle and liquid
- Viscosity of the liquid
- Gravitational or centrifugal force

Common examples: fruit pulp settling in juice, sand settling in water.
