At 34 I found myself surrounded by books, not knowing 
if I would read anything to completion again.

After working as a scientist for several years, reading non-academic work had become difficult. 
I had developed a tendency to treat books
as resources for extracting bits of information for use in projects.

I decided to pretend that I had never read anything at all.
That would encourage me to read books that had rearranged my brain once before,
in the hope that they might do so again.

I started with the smallest books on my shelf â€” like Musil's _Flypaper_.
That I had once read _Infinite Jest_ and _The Republic_ in college was no indicator that I would read anything even a fraction of their lengths again!
I am tracking my progress in the table below:
