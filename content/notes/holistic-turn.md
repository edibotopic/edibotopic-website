A holistic turn is an epistemological process, in which knowledge is reoriented towards the the *whole* of a system after a period of prolonged focus on the *parts* of a system.

This can manifest in transitions such as:

- Material → Form
- Analysis → Synthesis
- Composition → Structure
- Data collection → Model building
- Mechanism → Intuition

Holism is usually placed in opposition to reductionism. However, holism is itself typically reductionistic. A holism that urges us to focus on intuition and appearances, over mechanism and causality, is merely a reduction to a particular level of abstraction.

It is important to not consider reductionism in strict _spatial_ terms by --- for example --- thinking of it as always concerning a move from big to small. More generally, it is a framing that prioritises some set of concerns above others.

[Systemism](/notes/systemism) is the unification of reductionism and holism, which is often characteristic of effective investigations.
