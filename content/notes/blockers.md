# Blockers

_Epistemological obstacle_ was the term used by Gaston Bachelard in
[The Formation of the Scientific Mind](https://www.topoi.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/The-Formation-of-the-Scientific-Mind.pdf)
to describe false ideas that impede our progress in learning about the world.
He was specifically referring to ideas — most often metaphors — that
persisted in science for extended periods through history.

Similarly, the famous computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra highlighted the
(dead) metaphor of the programming "bug" in his
[On the cruelty of really teaching computing science](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1036.html#:~:text=The%20animistic%20metaphor%20of%20the,is%20the%20programmer's%20own%20creation):

> We could, for instance, begin with cleaning up our language by no longer calling a bug a bug but by calling it an error. It is much more honest because it squarely puts the blame where it belongs, viz. with the programmer who made the error. The animistic metaphor of the bug that maliciously sneaked in while the programmer was not looking is intellectually dishonest as it disguises that the error is the programmer's own creation. The nice thing of this simple change of vocabulary is that it has such a profound effect: while, before, a program with only one bug used to be "almost correct", afterwards a program with an error is just "wrong" (because in error).

While the bug metaphor seems harmless, Dijkstra argues that it shapes the practitioner's worldview in a pathological way.
Bugs are entities that spontaneously appear and when they do we must initiate a process of debugging.
The introduction of errors becomes naturalised and accepted, a fundamental part of a workflow.

Bachelard and Dijkstra are iconoclasts.
They do not wish to replace metaphors with other, better metaphors,
but rather to destroy metaphors entirely as obscuring forces.
Instead of invoking the image of a bug, we should aim for
correctness when writing programs.

The bug metaphor itself is generative of [inverse problems](@/notes/inverseproblems.md).
It allows for the multiplication of _effects_ with unknown _causes_.
To solve the problem we have to begin each time the difficult process of approaching the unknown.
A great deal of a programmer's time is devoted to finding and eliminating bugs of unkown origin.

I am unsure how far the notion of the epistemological obstacle extends.

Of course there are the mundane "blockers" of the corporate or bureaucratic variety.
Someone can't complete a task because another person didn't complete their own task.
A chain of dependencies.

Then there are the more interesting varieties, like the [emotional blockers](https://www.todepond.com/report/arroost/) that prevent
us from creating art or expressing ourselves.

Even if metaphors can obscure the truth they are often a pragmatic device, turning
us towards new possibilities.
This is certainly the case in art but also the exploratory phase of science.

There is the general class of blockers, which inhibit, constrain, redirect,
but also the particular ways that we must contend with each.
