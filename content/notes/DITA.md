## Overview

Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA) is a standard commonly used for
writing technical documentation.

It describes how topics can be organised effectively into specific [information
types](/notes/information-types) and mechanisms for reusing those topics.

## Types

Early versions of the DITA specification included three primary types:

* Task: procedural guidelines for achieving a goal, such as a how-to
* Concept: explanatory information, background, and overviews
* Reference: concise, factual material, like an API reference

Later specifications include more specialised types, including:

* Troubleshooting
* Glossary terms
* Learning overviews

DITA is extensible, and it is possible to create additional types as
the problem domain requires.
