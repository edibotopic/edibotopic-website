I'm a **technical author** in software development.
Previously I was a teacher and researcher in food technology.

Here I maintain a [blog](@/blog/_index.md) and write [notes](@/notes/_index.md)
about **technical** and **philosophical** topics.

You can find links to some of my work in science, programming and music
on the [projects](@/projects/_index.md) page.

If you would like to **collaborate** on anything just send an email to
[edibotopic@gmail.com](mailto:edibotopic@gmail.com).
