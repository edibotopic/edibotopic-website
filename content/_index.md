I'm a **technical author** in software development who
previously worked as a university academic.

Here I maintain a [blog](@/blog/_index.md) and post about
[projects](@/projects/_index.md) in **research**, **programming** and
**music**.

If you would like to **collaborate** on a project just send an email to
[edibotopic@gmail.com](mailto:edibotopic@gmail.com).
