I'm a technical author in software development.
Previously I was a teacher and researcher in food technology.

Here I mostly keep notes, update a regular journal and sometimes write longer
blogs about whatever I'm interested in at the time.

You can find links to some of my work in science, programming and music
on the projects page.
