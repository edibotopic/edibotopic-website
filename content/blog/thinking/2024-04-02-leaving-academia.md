I'm leaving academia.

<!-- more -->

This May I will be joining [Canonical](www.canonical.com) as a _Technical
Author_.

After a 4 year BSc, 4 year PhD, 1 year postdoc and over 7 years as a
tenured academic, it seemed like the right time to do something new.

Academics often write lengthy articles that outline
their reasons for quitting a university position.
This genre of [quit lit](https://archive.ph/20191220233328/https://chroniclevitae.com/news/216-why-so-many-academics-quit-and-tell) is filled with
sharp critiques of the modern university.
To most non-professors, getting a new job is a normal and positive event,
and that's the approach I am taking to this change.

Moving from academia to industry is not easy though, especially when it involves a
change in discipline and [a famously rigorous hiring process](https://canonical.com/documentation/work-and-careers#how-we-hire).
The transition itself has been fascinating and I've learned a lot.
Once I've settled into post-academic life I'd like to write about that process.

In the last few years, I became absorbed by experiments in
programming and documentation. 
I even began to incorporate software concepts and tooling in my academic work,
[publishing a paper on an open-source physics simulation](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jchemed.2c01201),
[redesigning course notes according to the Diataxis framework](https://edibotopic.github.io/milkWheyAndCo/)
and [introducing version control for our student projects](https://edibotopic.com/docs/VersioningHandout.pdf).

Once I experienced documentation workflows based on plaintext and Git, it became hard to love the clunkiness of academic publishing.
Somewhere along the way I found myself thinking more about [virtual machines](https://edibotopic.com/blog/explaining/vagrant-virtualbox-ansible/) than milk proteins.
I had already published [about 70 scientific articles](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vWZ2uMAAAAAJ&hl=en) and wanted to apply those skills to something more practical.

Spending years immersed in teaching and research has been mind-expanding.
I got the opportunity to make original contributions to knowledge,
I helped talented people navigate four-year doctoral projects and I 
built university courses that shaped how the next generation of food
scientists approach their discipline.

Technical communication is a huge part of being an academic, whether it
involves writing course notes, processing data or delivering presentations.
My new role will allow me to work with a team to communicate effectively 
about complex software products.
I hope in the future that my varied background will have made me a well-rounded technical communicator.

While I was planning my departure I thought a lot about professional rugby players.
They commit most of their lives to rugby until they are forced to retire in
their mid- to late-thirties â€” if they're lucky to last that long.
Most rugby players do not make enough money to just retire
at that point, so they get a _regular_ job.

For some rugby players their entire identity is wrapped up in
their status as a professional athlete and the regimented lifestyle
it entails.
Their inevitable transition out of the game can be difficult.

Others plan their exit in advance and have a rewarding second act.

I'm 34.
I haven't broken my leg or suffered a severe concussion.
I've planned my exit and am excited about what's next.
I'll still have the memories, my trophies and a few insights
into how the game is played.
