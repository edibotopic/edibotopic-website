If someone does something interesting, nice or useful then
tell them.

[Lu Wilson](https://www.todepond.com/) is a talented and creative person who does many amazing things.
One of my favourite creations from Lu is [Arroost](https://arroost.com/), a visual tool for creating music from live samples.

I wrote a [little blog](https://edibotopic.com/blog/doing/leisure-sick/) where I explained why I liked Arroost
and how it helped me get out of a creative rut.
Seeing Lu reference the blog in [podcasts](https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/071) and [conference papers](https://www.todepond.com/report/arroost/)
has been surprising and gratifying.

It's enough sometimes to express that you value what someone has contributed.
You don't have to subject it to breathtaking analysis or critique.
You don't have to file an insightful bug report or transformative pull request.
You don't have to create your own more featureful version.
You don't have to become a looming parasocial entity.
You can just tell people what they did for you.

This can make someone feel good and encouraged about their work but it
can also help them to frame that work to themselves and to others.

I'm not just talking about "Your art saved my life, man!" type exclamations either,
although I'm not exactly opposed to those.

There were intentional decisions in Arroost's design that helped solve
a specific — if vaguely-defined — problem that I had (a creative block).
By describing how the tool contributed to its resolution, the decisions behind
the design are brought into sharp relief and — to an extent — vindicated.
Productive questions emerge: _what can be said in general concerning solutions to such problems?_

All that is to say: tell people what they did for you, preferably soon after
they have done it.

If someone responds to your work in a way that is meaningful to you
then [do like Lu](https://www.todepond.com/report/arroost/) and tell 
people about that too.

..Feed the loop, feed back through the loop, give back: feed the loop, a giveback loop,
loopback, give the feedback then loop, loop, _loop_...

_Which reminds me..._

# No feedback, bad feedback

At different times in my worklife I've felt like I was "managing up",
or maybe even "_counselling_ up".

I've had managers or seniors who I knew were under a lot of pressure.
When they solved a problem or had an insight I would try to make them
aware that I recognised what they just did:

> That idea is really interesting. I hadn't heard of that approach before.

> After our last meeting I tried what you suggested and it made a huge difference. Thank you.

> Have you thought of saying this to the rest of the group? They could get a lot of value from it too.

They often responded positively:

> Yes, thanks for saying that! That is exactly what I was trying to do.

> That's nice to hear. It hasn't been universally popular and I've faced a lot of resistance.

> Thanks! You know, it's been difficult with everything else that's going on lately.

Sometimes they would seem a little embarrassed that they were getting unsolicited
feedback from a person of lower professional status.

Most often, I would get the impression that it was the first time in their recent
memory that anyone told them that they had done a good job.

They were in lonely positions, with teams looking to them for
help, guidance and feedback but nobody to offer them the same support.

Although I didn't expect reciprocation, it always surprised me when the same people 
didn't return the courtesy, especially when they were the ones in a mentoring role!

The main reasons for this — from what I could gather — were:

- A fear of making someone "too comfortable" and a desire to keep them seeking elusive praise
- A sense that great work was an expectation and not something worthy of remark
- An immediate instinct to exploit value rather than to acknowledge value

Tell people what they did for you, whether they're a manager or intern, 
teacher or student, friend or competitor, fan or influencer.

Give the damn feedback and be nice about it.

You don't need to wait until the graduation,
the christmas party, the promotion round,
the drunken exchange, the elderly recollection,
the acknowledgements section...

Don't be satisfied that you have merely "provided feedback" either, and
whether it is "constructive" is just one aspect of good feedback.
The person receiving the feedback should feel encouraged to continue,
if the expectation is that they will — in fact — continue.
Feedback is an opportunity to correct mistakes but
also to make connections and create possibilities.
