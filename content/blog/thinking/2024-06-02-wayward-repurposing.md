When trying to achieve something it's possible to fail.
Byproducts of that failure can be repurposed for some new task.

<!-- more -->

Applied to a common domain or purpose this can be rewarding â€”
the same problem gets solved, the same money gets made.

Yet wayward repurposing can also be parasitic on our unrealised ambitions.

Someone names products after ideas that they once wanted to write about.
Another dreamed of saving a species and now keeps them alive in their wallpaper
choice.

Good ideas are disappeared into all kinds of mundane places.

The faint echoes of the unaccomplished provide comfort in a minor project as
the old ambition dies and the idea weakens with every dilution.

Better to use an idea than not at all, still better to do so properly and to
the fullest extent.

It's not easy.
