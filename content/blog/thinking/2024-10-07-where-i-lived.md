I've lived in some different places.
Here are the ones I remember.

<!-- more -->

# Growing up

_Near Blarney, County Cork, Ireland_

I grew up in the countryside, went to a small
Catholic school and played a lot of video games.

When I was a teenager I went to school in Blarney (yes, the one with the castle),
which was about a 20 minute bus ride away.
As I got older my friends and I would go drinking 
in the Blarney woods and talk about everything.

The family house was a bungalow surrounded by farmland.
There is a crashed car in the back garden and I don't
know how it got there.

# Factory cottage

_On the site of a manufacturing company in Aberdeenshire, Scotland_

I did an internship for a company in Scotland that had cottages on company land.
They put us up in one for a month until we could find a place in the city.
It was peculiar living in a relatively idyllic cottage in sight of the manufacturing facility that we walked to each morning.

Two of us would go to a local bar, where it was usually just us and the owner, who always seemed like he was after a few pints.

Something difficult happened during that time which had a big impact on me.
I can't really go into it.

# Place for two for three

_Apartment in Aberdeen city, Scotland_

The three of us found it impossible to find a three bedroom apartment
in Aberdeen.
So we pretended there was only two of us and I slept on the couch for six months.
I watched and rewatched Twin Peaks on a laptop every night.

Aberdeen is not a fashionable city but I liked it.
There's a beach at the city's edge with carnival attractions and
oil rigs in the distance.
A strange configuration.

We never met the absentee landlord and never got our deposit back.

# Studio I avoided

_Tiny studio in Sunday's Well, Cork city, Ireland_

This was a small, old studio in a house with five other tenants.
The studio was bleak.
I don't think I had the internet and there were mushrooms in the landing.

I wanted to spend as little time as possible there.
I worked late on my PhD and stopped in a pub on the way home.
Five old guys sat at the bar ribbing each other and I would read the newspapers nearby.

An unusual man downstairs once invited me into his place when I came home.
He asked me to sit down on the couch and then he did a nunchuck demonstration â€” it wasn't very good and I was nervous for both of us.
Afterwards he gave me a large block of government cheese that he no longer wanted and said goodnight. I never saw him again.

Sunday's Well is one of the wealthier areas of Cork city.
Lots of doctors, solicitors and professors live there.
I could rent there for one year during the recession and it has
been beyond my financial reach ever since.

# Shared house with musicians

_Shared house in Lower Janemount, Cork city, Ireland_

I had to leave the studio after a year because the landlord sold up.

I went from living on my own to living with seven other people.
Most of them were musicians.
From where I slept, there was a trained opera singer at one side and a really bad singer on the other; I would often hear both of them practising at the same time, which was quite something.

I only lived there for a year because I got a scholarship to do research abroad.

I met my partner during this time.
She was from the place I was going (Midwest of the USA).

# Apartment blocks in the Midwest

_Apartments in Madison, Wisconsin, USA_

I lived in two buildings in Madison, Wisconsin.
The first was really small and I shared it with a lovely guy who watched sermons on YouTube.
To my relief he never mentioned anything about religion.
He was a really nice person.

Then I moved to the 11th floor of a nearby building.
It was a studio and I lived there alone.
I had a view of frat houses and a big lake from my balcony.

I had no internet so I would download podcasts while I was doing laundry in the basement.
The elevator always gave the impression that it was about to malfunction.

Madison has boiling summers and icy Winters.
When Winter hit it was a kind of cold I had never experienced.
I shivered into the Winter supplies store and said:

> Hi. I'm Irish and I don't know what to wear....

They gave me gators, wicking layers, insulating layers and a bunch
of other things so that I wouldn't freeze to death.

To this day I love Madison as a city.
Very laid-back, hippy-ish vibe.
Lovely bookshop and record store.
Lakeside terrace with beer, food and music.

# Place with door-sized hole

_Apartment in Shandon Street, Cork City, Ireland_

I moved back to Ireland and got a tenured position as an academic.
It was to be the first time since I left home that I would
live somewhere for more than a single year.

This house had a lot of problems.
Worst was the frequent rodent issues.
Some weeks I would catch almost ten mice.

Eventually the apartment underneath was gutted.
For infrastructural reasons, one of our rooms had to be removed.
This left a large hole in the wall that was covered with a thin board
for several months.
There was construction noise and dust from below and a cold draft
coming through the hole.

My partner and I spent the Covid lockdowns here.
We had no garden, so we would walk out onto the roof
and talk to our friend in the apartment below.

It was a happy time for us despite everything that was going on.

Shandon street is a unique place on the North side of Cork city.
There is a mixture of traditional Irish shops and bars
but also a lot of African-owned businesses, as well as
a Mosque.

Sometimes when I told people where I lived they would have
a funny reaction.
They would say it was dangerous and they wouldn't believe
me when I said otherwise.

# With a garden, near a stadium

_A house in Turner's Cross, outside Cork City, Ireland_

We moved from the North to the South side of the city.
The South side is generally considered more affluent.
Now when I told people where I was living they would say "Oh, that's nice.".

The area was very residential, with lots of kids playing around.
The main attraction for us was that we finally had a small garden.

We were near a stadium and there was regular crowd noise.
It amazed me how pleasant a sound it was to hear.

We had a lot of problems with the property manager.
The place was never cleaned after the previous tenants left.
Lots of things were broken.
There was a mould issue.
We needed to press a weight against the fridge to keep it closed.

After two years the landlord said they wanted
to give the place to one of their children.

In the few months that remained on our lease we
looked for apartments and were considering the
prospect of homelessness it was so difficult.

We did find a place in the end.

# Back on the north side

_The house where I live now_

We are now living on the North side of Cork city again.

People tell me that where I live is dangerous.
I think they say things like that because there is social housing.
The place is perfectly fine and I don't know what they're talking about.

I think some people haven't lived in different places, so they don't
realise that there are great people everywhere.

This is probably the place I've lived with the strongest feeling of community.
People really look out for each other.
There's always conversations happening.

One peculiar feature is the fireworks.
As October approaches there is constant, intermittent fireworks.
I don't know where exactly they are coming from.
It must be just a fun thing people do.

I left my academic job and now work in software.
The work is remote so I spend a lot of time here.

We rent and might live somewhere else again soon.
