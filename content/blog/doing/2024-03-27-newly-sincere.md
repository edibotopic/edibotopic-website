I'm still making odd, [woozy](https://www.echolive.ie/entertainment/whatson/arid-40902209.html) music.

Between December 2023 and February 2024 I released five music projects under a
pseudonym[^1].
I like them a lot and wish I could share them here but that would defeat the
purpose. 
Everything I made in March and April 2024 was closer in spirit to my (then-defunct)
[Curtsy Rehearsed](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/) 
project so I decided to release them under that old moniker.

The most recent project is
[Rurality](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/album/rurality)
, which I made in a day after a short trip to the countryside.
It was mostly inspired by "found scenes", like peculiar country sheds
bursting with wood and decorated with buoys.
I like the idea of making tiny albums as an immediate response to
an experience and it's something I intend to explore.

Just before _Rurality_ I made
[Newly Sincere](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/album/newly-sincere).
I was really happy with how this one turned out â€” I'm especially partial to track 5.
Here I finally abandoned any pretence of making hip-hop and it was freeing.
Drums are almost completely absent in this one and that
forced me to experiment more with mood, percussion and texture.

[Punctums](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/album/punctums)
was a direct response to _Newly Sincere_.
After a largely drumless project I wanted to use drums again!
Programming drums is something I tend to find quite boring so
I varied the tempo and time signatures a lot to make it more
interesting for me and the listener.
Each song was made by first laying down the drums and I think
this made them feel more integrated.

These albums are available on 
[BandCamp](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/) 
for free but you can offer a donation if you like.
It's always a pleasant surprise when my incompetence at marketing pays off.
