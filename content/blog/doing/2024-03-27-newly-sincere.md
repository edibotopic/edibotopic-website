I'm still making odd, woozy music.

<!-- more -->

Between December 2023 and February 2024 I released five music projects under a
pseudonym.
I like them a lot and wish I could share them here but that would defeat the
purpose. 
Everything I made in March and April was closer in spirit to my then-defunct
[Curtsy Rehearsed](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/) 
project so I decided to release them under that old moniker.

I was really pleased with how 
[Newly Sincere](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/album/newly-sincere)
turned out.
Abandoning any pretence of making hip-hop was freeing.
Drums are almost completely absent.
This meant I experimented more with mood, percussion and texture.

I then made a very drum-heavy project in the form of
[Punctums](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/album/punctums).
Programming drums is something I tend to find quite boring.
This time around I varied the tempo and time signatures a lot and 
the songs are pretty interesting insofar as instrumental hip-hop goes.

After a short trip to the countryside I put together
[Rurality](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/album/rurality) in a
day, inspired by what I saw as I anticipated my return to the city.
I like this idea of making tiny albums as an immediate response to
an experience â€” maybe that's something to explore.

These albums are available on 
[BandCamp](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/) 
for free but you can offer a donation if you like.
It's always a pleasant surprise when my incompetence at marketing pays off.
