I spent six years on a scientific project that got funded when I quit academia.

<!-- more -->

Recently the Irish government announced that they would be funding TRANSFORM, an abbreviation for the clunky:

> ThermoReversing Advanced Nutritional Structures as Fortification Option in Recipes for Malnutrition

I first wrote that clunky title about seven years ago when I started working as an academic food scientist.

The project received almost one million Euro in funding and will support multiple PhD, MSc and PostDoc researchers for four years.

I think it's worth discussing the project here for a few reasons.
Firstly, the idea itself is quite interesting and I think someone might not be aware of the problem that needs to be solved.
Secondly, the way I designed the project concept was informed by philosophy, and I want to explain why.
Thirdly, it's a unique opportunity to explore what it takes to get a large project funded and what it's like to hand it over.
