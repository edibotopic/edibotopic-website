I'm leaving academia.

<!-- more -->

# Something New

I decided to leave about a year ago.
This May I will be joining [Canonical](www.canonical.com) as a _Technical
Author_.

After a 4 year BSc, a 4 year PhD, a 1 year postdoc and over 7 years as a
tenured academic, it seemed like a good time to try something new.

# Transition

Academics often write lengthy articles that outline
their reasons for quitting a university position.
This genre of academic [quit lit](www.google.com) is filled with
blistering critiques of the modern university.

Outside of college campuses it can be a normal, positive event when someone
changes jobs.
Moving from academia to industry is not easy, however, especially when it
involves
[one of the most extensive hiring processes in software](www.google.com).
The transition has been really interesting and I already feel like I've
learned a lot in the process.

# Preoccupations

In the last few years, I became preoccupied with experiments in
programming and documentation. 
I even began to incorporate software concepts and tools in my academic work,
[publishing a paper on an open-source physics simulation](www.google.com),
[redesigning course notes according to the Diataxis framework](www.google.com)
and [recommending version control for student projects](www.google.com).

My new role will allow me to focus more on writing and software, while getting
experience working in a distributed team.

# No Regrets

Being immersed in teaching and research is mind-expanding.
I got the opportunity to make original contributions to knowledge,
I helped talented people navigate four-year doctoral projects and I 
built university courses that shaped how the next generation of food
scientists approach their discipline.

I've been thinking a lot about professional rugby players.
They commit most of their lives to rugby until they are forced
to retire in their mid- to late-thirties.
Most rugby players do not make enough money to simply retire
at that point, so many get a regular job or go back to college.

For some rugby players their entire identity is wrapped up in
their status as a professional athlete and the regimented lifestyle
it entails.
Their inevitable transition out of the game can be difficult.
Others plan early for their exit and have a rewarding second act.

I'm 34.
I haven't broke my leg or suffered a severe concussion.
I've planned my exit and am excited about a new job.
I'll still have the memories, the trophies and the insights
into how the game is played.
