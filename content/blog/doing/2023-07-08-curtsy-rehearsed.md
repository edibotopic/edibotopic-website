{% note(header="Note") %}
The music I was making had a sharp uptick in quality
around [February 2024](#update-february-2024).
My most recent and favourite releases are mentioned
in the [Summer 2024 update](#update-summer-2024).

Several of the earlier projects discussed at the
start of this blog have been unpublished from BandCamp
but can still be streamed/downloaded on this page.

# Background

## Press Coverage

As I have made little to no effort at self-promotion
I was surprised to find that an old Curtsy Rehearsed
project had received some press attention in the Summer of 2022, 
albeit in a local Irish paper that few people know about.

I like the mini-review, which correctly identifies the music's _wooziness_.
Since then I have made far better music that has received no attention.
The article referred to _Transitive Nostalgia_, which has been made private on
my Bandcamp although you can still stream/download below:

</div>

The most minor press coverage motivated me to explain why 
I — an academic, non-musician — started this project.

## Soundtracks to Lectures  

My original motivation was to soundtrack lectures.
During the era of Covid-19 lockdowns I had to teach remotely.
I wanted to create _good_ lecture videos, which — for me —
_had to include music_.
In my naivety, I immediately (and fairly) got a 
strike on YouTube for using copyrighted music.
I then looked for some copyright-free music but hated all of it.
In the absence of alternatives, I decided to make my own music.

The songs I made are an interesting artifact of the time.
Most of them are included in the three-part
_Theory of Parts_ series, named after a
metaphysics paper I was then struggling to
write and publish.

The anxieties of the early-phase of the pandemic
bled into the songs, even if they were only intended
as interludes to lectures on food chemistry!
One of my favourites from that period — 
"You Won't For Long, Then You Will Again" —
was a reflection on the constraints young people were living
under and the anticipation of being free of them.
The album art was my "garden" at the time, a network of 
pipes and vents inhabiting a forgotten space behind
old city apartments and businesses.

</div>

## Experiment and Bricolage

I am not a _real_ musician. I just _do_ music.

Not being a musician I rely on whatever
capacity I have _as a listener_ and
an openness to use whatever is to hand.
I find sounds I like and combine them.
When I make something that sounds bad I modify,
replace and arrange until it sound better.

I don't know what I'm doing.

I conceive of the process as "experimental" in a loosely _scientific_ sense:
there are a set of questions regarding a mixture of 
components (sounds), followed by an arduous sequences of 
(listening) tests of those hypotheses, which may involve the substitution
or modification of the components, before a promising
idea begins to emerge and is refined for eventual presentation.

Sometimes I judge that a song has not succeeded.
Yet these failures often get re-incorporated into something new.
A recent successful song-making procedure looked like this:

1. Two failed songs were re-sampled and combined
2. A phone recording of me singing incoherently was digitally processed
3. Samples from a pre-WW1 woodwind recording were found and incorporated
4. Everything was tweaked, arranged and mixed over several days
5. Eventually the results felt good

Other songs were built mostly with code, like 
[Algotaylorist](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/track/algotaylorist)
using [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/)
and the [title track](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/track/dereferenced-2)
of Dereferenced using [Tidal Cycles](https://tidalcycles.org/)

Some were composed in a more traditional way, with me
poking at a MIDI keyboard in an amateurish manner until I
captured something that sounded right.

I have no universal recipe, partially due to
my own impatience and inconsistency.

## Music for What Exactly?

I wouldn't recommend the music for a dinner party.
I don't think it can be danced to.
I am unsure if it will lull anyone to sleep.
The songs, I feel, are useful as prompts for thinking about
whatever: creativity, memories, technology, modern life...

Having a library of songs helped me design lectures.
If I wanted students to feel the gravity of a weighty topic
I would use a more sinister song, like 
[Being Qua Being](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/track/being-qua-being-3).
To create a sense of optimism about the potential of science and
technology I might use the synthetic but hopeful
[Progress is Monotonic](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/track/progress-is-monotonic-3).
In lighter moments, or when I needed to switch gears, I would play the retro-gaming-sounding
[Fantasy Machines](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/track/fantasy-machine).

My favourite part about making these songs is that when I listen back to them
they are a mystery to me:

_What was I thinking when I made that?_
_Why does it sound the way it does?_
_How did I decide to give it that title?_

They become tools for introspection.

</div>

## Goodbye Curtsy?

This project had some degree of baggage, forged as it was in a crisis.
I still associate the making of music with the job of doing lectures.
As it was originally intended as "background music" I didn't want
to foreground myself too much, which is one of the reasons vocals
are either absent or obscured.

One of the first Curtsy Rehearsed songs does include me singing,
albeit filtered through a fairly heavy vocoder:

<div style="text-align: center">
    <iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 350px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=819553730/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/minimal=true/track=1694530571/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/album/theory-of-parts-inclusion">Theory of Parts: Inclusion by Curtsy Rehearsed</a></iframe>
</div>

When my voice is present in other songs I might
not even be able to identify it as such.
It could sound like something else entirely now.
Twisted, fragmented and mangled beyond recognition.

## Empathy for Musicians

One benefit of trying hard to make and release music is the
sense of empathy it created in me for those who do this with even
greater seriousness.

Mastering is a painstaking and complex process,
which I know very little about.
Doing it well ensures that the collection of
sounds have an optimal quality across a 
range of devices, platforms and listening situations.

It reminds me of the least fun part of another sometimes
hobby — coding — where you try to ensure
what you make is available/accessible to the broadest
group of people.
Say you've made an interesting game or animation but now:

> Does it run on Windows, Mac and Linux?
> If it runs in a browser does it run on
> this specific browser that 2% of internet 
> users still use?
> How does it look on the smallest phone screen
on the market?

Similarly, you might make a song that sounds great on
headphones but what about earbuds?
What about one earbud?
What about cheap bluetooth speakers?
What about YouTube after it compresses the file?
Early on I realised that certain
recording artifacts like high-frequency
pops and cracks were only evident when
I listened on earbuds.
So I would try to first mix with
headphones and then with earbuds.
Then I noticed that the mix would
sound muddy through speakers!

Even if you compose, mix and master everything to
your satisfaction, there is no guarantee that the manner
in which it is heard will be as you intended.
A coherent album, with a tone that evolves and
tracks that provide context for each other, may
be summarily dismissed after a 12-15 second
preview of two tracks, listened to out-of-order
through a single bluetooth earbud.

You should be encouraged to learn new skills even 
when they might initially seem beyond your abilities.
You will get better in the trying and 
might even make something worthwhile.
At a minimum, you will develop a greater
appreciation for the difficulties that
its practitioners must overcome.

# Summer 2024

This Summer I released two new [Curtsy Rehearsed](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/) projects.

## Kinds of Summer

[Kinds of Summer](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/album/kinds-of-summer)
is the first thing I've made that feels "summery".
I particularly like the dancey urgency of the [title song](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/track/kinds-of-summer) — and the
stoned, washed out quality of the next one — [Nicely Tired with a Warm Buzz](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/track/nicely-tired-with-a-warm-buzz).
These are genuine head-nodders, but I'm (sadly) biased...

## Paradise Syndrome

[Paradise Syndrome](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/album/paradise-syndrome)
is almost completely sampled from old bossa nova tracks, although you might
not be able to tell with the cold, spacey hip-hop of [So Blown Through](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/track/so-blown-through) or the
roboticised pep of [Encouragement Song](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/track/encouragement-song-2).
It's far more obvious with [My Idle Animation](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/track/my-idle-animation-2) and the [title track](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/track/paradise-syndrome-2).

I really like the Summer 2024 releases, let me know if you do too.

Some notable features:

- All the Curtsy Rehearsed music is now free: there's an option to pay that I'm only leaving open because it helps with search-indexing, so I recently learned.
- I stopped caring so much about LUFS: these songs are mixed louder than my conventional target of 14 LUFS and it's to their benefit. The 14 came from when I researched LUFS normalisation on streaming services but I don't put my music there anymore so there's no point.
- Upping the tempo: the first song in Kinds of Summer has a BPM of >120, which is at least double what I would commonly use before and firmly in the vicinity of dance music.
If BandCamp had per-song genre tagging I might have used the "dance" tag at least once.

Now I want to do something creative that isn't music for a while.

I'm not sure what it will be.

# April 2024

## Rurality

I made this in a day after a short trip to the countryside.
It was mostly inspired by "found scenes", like peculiar country sheds
bursting with wood and decorated with buoys.
I like the idea of making tiny albums as an immediate response to
an experience and it's something I intend to explore.

# March 2024

## Punctums

[Punctums](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/album/punctums)
was a direct response to February's _Newly Sincere_.
After a largely drumless project I wanted to use drums again!
Programming drums is something I tend to find quite boring so
I varied the tempo and time signatures a lot to make it more
interesting for me and the listener.
Each song was made by first laying down the drums and I think
this made them feel more integrated.

# February 2024

## Newly Sincere

I was really happy with how [Newly Sincere](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/album/newly-sincere) turned out — I'm especially partial to track 5 (below).
Here I finally abandoned any pretence of making hip-hop and it was freeing.
Drums are almost completely absent in this one and that
forced me to experiment more with mood, percussion and texture.
