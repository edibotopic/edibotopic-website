I made something Summery and sampled some bossa nova.

<!-- more -->

So far this Summer I've released two new
[Curtsy Rehearsed](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/) 
projects.

# Kinds of Summer

[Kinds of Summer](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/album/kinds-of-summer)
is the first thing I've made that feels "summery".
I particularly like the dancey urgency of the [title song](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/track/kinds-of-summer) — and the
stoned, washed out quality of the next one — [Nicely Tired with a Warm Buzz](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/track/nicely-tired-with-a-warm-buzz).
These are genuine head-nodders, but I'm (sadly) biased...

# Paradise Syndrome

I also released
[Paradise Syndrome](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/album/paradise-syndrome).
This one is almost completely sampled from old bossa nova tracks, although you might
not be able to tell with the cold, spacey hip-hop of [So Blown Through](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/track/so-blown-through) or the
roboticised pep of [Encouragement Song](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/track/encouragement-song-2).
It's far more obvious with [My Idle Animation](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/track/my-idle-animation-2) and the [title track](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/track/paradise-syndrome-2).

I really like these, let me know if you do too.

Some notable features:

- All the Curtsy Rehearsed music is now free: there's an option to pay that I'm only leaving open because it helps with search-indexing, I recently learned.
- I stopped caring so much about LUFS: these songs are mixed louder than my conventional target of 14 LUFS and it's to their benefit. The 14 came from when I researched LUFS normalisation on streaming services but I don't put my music there anymore so there's no point.
- Upping the tempo: the first song in Kinds of Summer has a BPM of >120, which is at least double what I would commonly use before and firmly in the vicinity of dance music.
If BandCamp had per-song genre tagging I might used the "dance" tag at least once.

Now I want to do something creative that isn't music for a while.

I'm not sure what it will be.
