I made something Summery, I sampled some bossa nova.

<!-- more -->

So far this Summer I've released two new
[Curtsy Rehearsed](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/) 
projects.

# Stages of Summer

[Stages of Summer](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/album/stages-of-summer)
is the first thing I've made that feels "summery".
I particularly like the dancey urgency of the first song — [Just Before](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/track/just-before) — and the
stoned, washed out quality of the next one — [Early On](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/track/early-on).
These are genuine head-nodders, but I'm (sadly) biased...

# Paradise Syndrome

I also released
[Paradise Syndrome](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/album/paradise-syndrome).
This one is almost completely sampled from old bossa nova tracks, although you might
not be able to tell with the cold, spacey hip-hop of [So Blown Through](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/track/so-blown-through) or the
roboticised pep of [Encouragement Song](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/track/encouragement-song-2).
It's far more obvious with [My Idle Animation](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/track/my-idle-animation-2) and the [title track](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/track/paradise-syndrome-2).

I really like these, let me know if you do too.

Some notable features:

- Everything is now just free with no option to pay: I would very occasionally get small donations but it's not worth it for some of the friction introduced by the payment prompts.
- I stopped caring so much about LUFS: these ones are mixed louder than my conventional target of 14 LUFS and it's to their benefit.
- Upping the tempo: the first song in Stages of Summer has a bpm of >120, which is at least double what I would commonly use before and firmly in the vicinity of "dance" music.

For a variety of reasons I'm thinking about moving away from sampling for a while.
As a part of this transition I am working on a project that involves sampling some
of my earlier music that did not use any samples.
I've been wanting to do that for a while.
Maybe it'll help get sampling out of my system.
