There's a kind of scientific project that bothers me. First, an
extravagant claim is made by a researcher. Next, this encourages other
researchers pursue a set of loosely-related questions that don't test
the original claim. The interestingness or importance of these
questions are then *conditional* on the truth of the initial, 
untested claim.

A few years ago a scientist approached me about a potential
collaboration. There had been a big fuss about a particular food
product. Another scientist had claimed that this food product could be
responsible for a wide range of medical issues affecting human
populations.

Many years had passed since this claim was made and there was still
little supporting evidence. The scientific justification for the claim
had been roundly criticised by the scientific community. That the
original scientist had since built a profitable company purporting to
sell a "healthier" version of the product attracted some well-earned
suspicion.

In my office, the scientist and I both shared the view that the
original claim was likely bogus. They reminded me, however, that there
was a lot of interest in this topic and that it could be the basis of
a lucrative funding proposal. The scientist assured me that while the
work would focus on the food product, none of the research would
relate directly to the tricky question of its health effects.

Imagine[^1] that the food product in question was claimed to be a
major contributor to heart disease. *If that were true*, some
healthier alternatives would need to be developed. We would then focus
on the science of their flavour and texture, such that *in the event
they were needed* people might find them tolerable to consume. This is
a common strategy in food science because many food scientists do not
have the expertise to study health effects. A product will attract
interest and prestige because of its health effects (real or not) and
food scientists will study everything but those health effects.

Funding proposals, press releases and lectures relating to such a
project will then all start with the premise that the product under
investigation has been claimed to be a major contributor to human
disease, even if this claim is not to be tested.

Food science is an applied field. Even if the original claim was false
it was certainly true that there was now a market interest in
"healthier" versions of the product. As the market potential for these
products existed there were companies who wanted to invest in their
manufacture. To implement this technology effectively *good science*
was required and so funding was made available by governments and
corporations.

The average member of the public then got confronted with products
that (prematurely) claimed to address their health issues. In
parallel, there were press releases and newspaper articles about the
legitimate science that was focused on these products. It is
unsurprising then that many people started to buy these products and
assume that they were important.

To the scientists involved there was somehow no conflict between
thinking that the original health claim **is probably bullshit** and
securing research funding on the basis that the health claim **is
probably not bullshit**. For those who do acknowledge the conflict they
might appeal to pragmatism/desperation ("I have to get my research
funded somehow"), philosophy/misdirection ("Good science is found in
the unlikeliest of places") or specialisation/ignorance ("Oh I'm not
an expert in health so who is to know really").

Let's consider now why this might be a problem.

Other real problems of actual consequence exist and need to be solved.
Given the existence of real problems that are known to affect people
right now then these should be the focus of investment and research,
not possible issues that can be reasonably assumed to not exist.

Public perception is also influenced by the rhetoric of science. If a
technology is actively being marketed as important for health then
scientific research that doesn't test or challenge this claim may lend
legitimacy to the product, even if the science itself operates at the
periphery of the original claim.

In popular discourse there is a skepticism about food and nutritional
sciences. It is common to hear about corporations trying to get people
addicted to their products or the failure of the entire scientific
enterprise to tackle the complexity of food and diet. I think these
criticisms are often grandiose and unfounded, frequently missing the
important contributions that these sciences have made to society.
However, I think that there is sometimes a cynicism and opportunism in
how scientists choose their projects, especially when the scientific
problems relate to a technology of potential commercial value. Food
products making extraordinary claims come and go by the dozen. Some
eventually shrink their claims in response to regulatory scrutiny[^2].
In the intervening period — which can span decades — scientists help
shape the perception of technology, among students, funders and the
public. They therefore have some responsibility for considering the
impact of their choices, in terms of public understanding of science,
the effective use of resources and the perceived efficacy of their
discipline[^3].

I explained to the scientist[^3] that I was not interested. They later
received funding for the project. It was probably a bad career move on
my part but I am at peace with my decision.

[^1]: I do not want to focus on the product itself but rather the
    general issue it represents.

[^2]: A claim to treat a disease may become a promise of more "comfort".

[^3]: Who is a lovely person and great scientists by the way.
