## Press Coverage

As I have made little to no effort at self-promotion
I was surprised to find that the previous Curtsy Rehearsed
project (released 12 months prior) had received some press 
attention, albeit in a local Irish paper you may not have heard
about:

> Found at the business end of a recent Bandcamp dig, there’s
> relatively little that your writer knows about coder and
> music-maker Shane Crowley, outside of a keenly-honed grasp
> on technology’s ever-shifting contours as displayed in blogs
> linked out from his Curtsy Rehearsed project’s Bandcamp page.
> On the evidence of this lightly glitchy yet slightly woozy
> serving of electronic exploration, it’s a state of affairs
> your writer would like to rectify.

I like the mini-review, which correctly identifies the
*wooziness* of the music.
As it happens, the subject of the review —
[Transitive Nostalgia](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/album/transitive-nostalgia) —
is available for free on its
[Bandcamp page](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/album/transitive-nostalgia).

This exposure to the most minor of press coverage 
motivated me to explain why I — an academic, non-musician
who last *attempted* music in school — started this project and
what I was trying to achieve.

## Soundtracks to Lectures  

My original motivation was to soundtrack lectures.
During the era of Covid-19 lockdowns I had to teach remotely.
I wanted to create *good* lecture videos, which — for me —
had to include music.
In my naivety, I immediately (and fairly) got a copyright
strike on YouTube.
I then found some copyright-free music but hated all of it.
In the absence of alternatives, I decided to make my own music.

The resultant songs are an interesting artifact of the time.
Most of them are included in the three-part
*Theory of Parts* series, named after a
metaphysics paper I was then struggling to
write and publish.

The anxieties of the early-phase of the pandemic
bled into the songs, even if they were only intended
as interludes to lectures on food chemistry!
One of my favourites from that period — 
"You Won't For Long, Then You Will Again" —
was a reflection on the constraints young people were living
under and their anticipation of one day being free of them.
The album art was my "garden" at the time, a network of 
pipes and vents inhabiting a forgotten space behind
city apartments and businesses.

## Experiment and Bricolage

I am not a *real* musician, but I *do* music.
Not being a musician I rely on whatever
capacity I have *as a listener* and
an openness to use whatever is to hand.
I find sounds I like and combine them.
When they inevitably sound bad I modify,
replace and arrange until things sound better.

The process is experimental in the *scientific* sense:
there are a set of questions regarding a mixture of 
components (sounds), followed by an arduous sequences of 
tests of those hypotheses, which may involve the substitution
or modification of those components, before a central
idea begins to emerge and is refined for eventual presentation.

Sometimes I judge that a song has not succeeded.
Yet these failures often get re-incorporated into something new.
A recent successful song-making procedure looked like this:

1. Two failed songs were re-sampled and combined
2. A phone recording of me singing incoherently was processed
3. Samples from a pre-WW1 woodwind performance were incorporated
4. Everything was tweaked, arranged and mixed over several days

Other songs were built mostly with code, like 
[Algotaylorist](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/track/algotaylorist)
using [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/)
and the [title track](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/track/dereferenced-2)
of Dereferenced using [Tidal Cycles](https://tidalcycles.org/)

Some others were composed in a more traditional way, with me
poking at a MIDI keyboard in an amateurish manner until I
captured something that sounded right.

I have no universal recipe, partially due to
my own impatience and inconsistency.

## Music for What Exactly?

I wouldn't recommend the music for a dinner party.
I don't think it can be danced to.
I am unsure if it will lull anyone to sleep.
The songs, I feel, are useful as prompts for thinking about
creativity, memories, technology and modern life.

Having this library of songs helped me conceive and structure lectures.
If I wanted students to feel the gravity of a weighty topic
I would use a more sinister song, like 
[Being Qua Being](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/track/being-qua-being-3).
To create a sense of optimism about the potential of science and
technology I might use
[Progress is Monotonic](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/track/progress-is-monotonic-3).
In lighter moments, or when I needed to switch gears, I would play
[Fantasy Machines](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/track/fantasy-machine).

Sometimes I listen back to these songs and think:
*What was I thinking when I made that?*
*Why does it sound the way it does?*
*How did I decide to give it that title?*
They are — perhaps — tools for introspection.

## Goodbye Curtsy?

This project has a lot of baggage, forged as it was in a crisis.
I still associate the making of music with the job of doing lectures.
As it was originally intended as "background music" I didn't want
to foreground myself too much, which is one of the reasons vocals
are either absent or obscured.

One of the first Curtsy Rehearsed songs does include me singing,
albeit filtered through a fairly heavy vocoder:

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 350px; height: 350px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=819553730/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/minimal=true/track=1694530571/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/album/theory-of-parts-inclusion">Theory of Parts: Inclusion by Curtsy Rehearsed</a></iframe>

When my voice is present in other songs I might
not even be able to identify it as such.
It could sound like something else entirely now.
Twisted, fragmented and mingled beyond recognition.

Recently, I have wanted to place a greater emphasis on vocals, while
keeping things woozy and weird.
One of my reasons for processing my voice with vocoders and other 
effects was the low-quality of the sound recorded through my 
microphone.
After finally investing in an audio interface, my recording 
quality has increase dramatically.

With better audio fidelity it is time again to experiment with vocals
and lyrics in a serious way for the first time since my
school years (see the 
[deMake project where I revisit these early demos](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/album/demake-1-food-rocks-early-demos)).
So I am retiring Curtsy Rehearsed to create a new
secret alias. This is to encourage as much
experimentation as possible without concern for how a
wayward student or colleague might react.

## Empathy for Musicians

One benefit of trying hard to make and release music is the
sense of empathy it creates for those who do this with even
greater seriousness.

Mastering is a complex, technical and artful process,
which I know very little about.
Doing it well ensures that the collection of
sounds have an optimal quality across a 
range of devices, platforms and listening situations.

It reminds me of the least fun part of my other
hobby — app development — where you try to ensure
that the app is available/accessible to the broadest
group of people.
Say you've made an interesting game or animation but now:

> Does it run on Windows, Mac and Linux?
> If it runs in a browser does it run on
> this specific browser that 2% of internet 
> users still use?
> How does it look on the smallest phone screen
on the market?

Similarly, you might make a song that sounds great on
headphones but what about earbuds?
What about one earbud?
What about cheap bluetooth speakers?
What about YouTube after it compresses the file?
Early on I realised that certain
recording artifacts like high-frequency
pops and cracks were only evident when
I listened on earbuds.
So I would try to first mix with
headphones and then with earbuds.
Then I noticed that the mix would
sound muddy through speakers!

Even if you compose, mix and master everything to
your satisfaction, there is no guarantee that the manner
in which it is heard will be as you intended.
A coherent album, with a tone that evolves and
tracks that provide context for each other, may
be summarily dismissed after a 12-15 second
preview of two tracks, listened to out-of-order
through a single bluetooth earbud.

You should be encouraged to learn new skills even 
when they might initially seem beyond your abilities.
You will get better in the trying and 
might even make something worthwhile.
At a minimum, you will develop a greater
appreciation for the difficulties that
its practitioners must overcome.
