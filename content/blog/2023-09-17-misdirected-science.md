There's a kind of applied science that bothers me. It starts with
some extravagant claim that is made by a researcher. This then
encourages other researchers to pursue a set of loosely-related
questions that don't test the original claim. The material importance
of these derivative questions then becomes *conditional* on the truth of
that initial and untested claim.

<!-- more -->

This situation is distinct from pure, [curiosity-driven
research](/blog/on-interestingness). The research questions are not
necessarily interesting *in themselves*. They *would be* interesting
**if** the original claim was demonstrably true. The research is
motivated and constrained by a mere *unlikely possibility*, which
becomes a flimsy axiom[^1] undergirding the entire research effort.

A few years ago a scientist approached me about a potential
collaboration. There had been big excitement about a particular new
technology. Another scientist had claimed that a consumer product could
be responsible for an unusually wide range of health issues affecting
human populations.
This scientist was proposing that they had identified the source of the
health issue (a consumer product) as well as the technology that could 
solve the problem (a replacement product).

Significant time had passed since this claim was made and there was
still little supporting evidence. The (lack of) mechanistic
justification for the claim had been roundly criticised by the
scientific community. That the scientist who made the
original claim had since built a company that already
profited from selling their "healthier" replacement of the consumer
product fuelled additional skepticism.

In my office, my colleague and I both shared the view that the
original claim was likely bogus. They reminded me, however, that there
was a lot of interest in this topic and that it could be the basis of
a lucrative funding proposal. My colleague assured me that while the
work would focus on the product in question and its "healthier" replacement,
none of our research would relate directly to the controversial question of 
health effects.
The exciting and controversial health question was merely a shiny vessel in
which we could smuggle our more dull and legitimate scientific questions.

The focus of all this attention was a commercial food product[^2], and it
was claimed that it was a major contributor to human disease. *If that
was true*, some healthier alternatives would need to be developed. As
scientists, we might focus on enhancing the flavour and texture of
alternatives, such that *in the event that they were needed* people
might find them tolerable to consume. This is a common tendency in
food science because many food scientists do not have the expertise to
study health effects: a product will generate interest and prestige
because of its health effects (real or imagined) and food scientists
will study everything but those health effects.

The aura of the original health-claim — still untested yet now the
subject of intense marketing efforts — imbued all derivative research
projects with urgency and importance. Funding proposals, press
releases and lectures relating to such research projects lead with the
premise that the technology under investigation *could* be a major
factor in human disease. It became apparent in the conversation with
my colleague that even if the original claim was likely false there
was now growing commercial incentives fuelled by that claim. There
were companies who wanted to invest in the manufacture of these
"healthy" alternatives. To implement them effectively *good science*
was required and so funding was being made available by governments
and corporations.

*In the philosophical sense*, this kind of scientific rhetoric is
[bullshit](https://www.thecollector.com/revisiting-bullshit-harry-frankfurt-essay/).
It is fundamentally unconcerned with the truth of the claim that
motivates and justifies the whole research effort. Scientists conform
to the ideas set forth in the claim simply because it suits their
purposes.
This is corrosive to the pursuit of truth even if some
science gets done in the process.

Let's consider briefly why this might be an undesirable set of circumstances:

- Other real problems of actual consequence exist and need to be solved.
Given the existence of real problems that are known to affect people
right now then these should be the focus of investment and research,
not possible issues that can be reasonably assumed to not exist.

- Public perception is influenced by the rhetoric of science. If a
technology is being marketed as important then scientific research on
the technology that doesn't test its efficacy directly, and even
*assumes passively that it is efficacious*, may lend unwarranted
scientific legitimacy to that technology.

In popular discourse there is sometimes a skepticism about applied
sciences like food science. I think these criticisms are often
grandiose and unfounded, frequently missing the important
contributions that these sciences have made to society. However, I
think that there is sometimes a cynicism and opportunism in how
scientists choose their projects, especially when the scientific
problems relate to a technology of potential commercial value.
Technologies making extraordinary claims come and go by the dozen.
Some eventually shrink their claims in response to regulatory
scrutiny[^3]. In the intervening period — which can span many years —
scientists help shape the perception of technology, among students,
funders and the public. They therefore have some responsibility for
considering the impact of their choices, in terms of public
understanding of science, the effective use of resources and the
perceived societal role of their own discipline.

I explained to the scientist[^4] that I was not interested in
researching the technology. They later received funding for their
project. It was a bad career decision on my part and I'm glad I made
it.

[^1]: In a mathematical proof an axiom is taken to be a self-evident
    truth, stipulated so that the proof can be constructed.

[^2]: I do not want to focus on the product itself but rather the
    general issue it represents.
