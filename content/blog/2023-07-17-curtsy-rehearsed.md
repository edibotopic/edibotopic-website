I created music as Curtsy Rehearsed between 2021 and 2023.

Today I put the finishing touches on Dereferenced — the latest and
final release from *Curtsy Rehearsed*.
You can find all music releases by Curtsy Rehearsed

# Bricolage and Surprise

The sounds came from whatever was at hand,
including office stationary, field recordings 
and videogame samples.
My vocals and instrumentals are in there too,
although as the songs evolved I often lost track
of what was me and what was something else.

I've never really cared who hears the music.
There is a sense of reward in constructing things that
have the capacity to *surprise*, even when one 
has had a hand in their construction.
I like the idea that some people — even a single person —
might stumble on the music and find it interesting, but
I am also open to its continuing obscurity.

# A Soundtrack to Lectures  

At some point, I shared early versions of Curtsy Rehearsed music on
social media.
This resulted in the greatest listener numbers I've had but I
really hated the process and how it affected my approach
to putting the music together.
Once I caught myself strategising which hashtags would get the
most Twitter traction I abandoned the process entirely.

My original motivation was to soundtrack lectures.
During the time of Covid-19 lockdowns I wanted to do remote
teaching well by making videos that students would
want to watch.
After an early copyright strike on the music used in one
of my lectures I decided to make my own.
This quickly got out of hand.

The resultant songs are an interesting artifact, with the gravity
of the pandemic situation bleeding into songs that were intended
as intros to lectures on chemistry.
One of my favourites from that time is titled
"You Won't For Long, Then You Will Again", which 
was a reflection on the constraints we were living
under and the hope of being free of them:

# Goodbye Curtsy

The process of making a Curtsy Rehearsed song is a mystery to me.
I am not a trained musician, so I rely heavily on making songs that
are bad, recognising their problems and then venturing to fix them.
Sometimes I abandon entire songs only to sample and combine them
months later in a different song that *somehow* "works".

Ending the Curtsy project is about opening a space for doing a
different kind of music.
Despite having a decent microphone, the quality of my vocal
recordings was always poor.
This is partially why my vocals in Curtsy Rehearsed are processed to
such a degree that
listening back months later I might mistake them for a guitar or
trombone.
I recently purchased a proper audio interface, which has largely
solved the problem.
This has led me to explore more conventional and less demanding
approaches to putting songs together.
I think my next musical project will primarily focus on vocal
experimentation.

When the results get uploaded it will probably be under a different 
alias.
I have never taken advantage of the relative anonymity of the
internet.
