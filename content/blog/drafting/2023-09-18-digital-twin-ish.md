Leveraging the Digital Twin concept doesn't require
sophisticated electronics and a collaboration with
a mega-corporation.

# That's Pretty Neat, but can it do Time Travel?

I've always found it curious how some academics approach software.
Let's say that there is an academic who teaches about machines.
This academic draws pictures of the machines on paper, scans them and
shares them with students.

One day this academic meets someone who suggests that the drawings can
be created using a graphics application.
The academic dismisses the results:

> These graphics are only in 2D.
> For true immersion students should be able to view the model in 3D.
> Perhaps we should seek grant money for the latest VR headsets.

The academic continues to draw 2D images in pencil.

Later, someone presents the academic with interactive, 3D scenes of
the machines.
The academic is not impressed.

> Yes, OK, but is this connected to a real physical device?
> The virtual representation should be networked with a real machine.
> In this way, students can change parameters in the virtual model
> that have physical effects in the real world.
> Perhaps we should seek a major investment by
> a company specialising in Digital Twin technology

The academic continues to draw 2D images in pencil.
