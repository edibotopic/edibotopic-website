# My name on a podcast

I was name-dropped on the really excellent **Future of Coding** podcast.
My [post on using Arroost](https://edibotopic.com/blog/doing/leisure-sick/) was mentioned briefly by one of the hosts — Lu Wilson
— who also created Arroost.
As a regular listener to the show it was weird to hear my name when I didn't expect it!

[Episode 71: Elephant in the Room](https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/071)

Future of Coding is the only podcast about software that I have really enjoyed and I highly recommend it.
Lu has recently joined as a host and is a wonderful addition.

# New job at Canonical

As I [wrote about recently](https://edibotopic.com/blog/thinking/leaving-academia/), I left a job in academia to become a technical author.
I will be working on the Ubuntu Desktop team with a special focus on [WSL](https://ubuntu.com/desktop/wsl).
Ubuntu has been my main OS for years after initially starting with WSL.

I'm about a month into the job and have already learned a huge amount about
software and documentation.
Almost immediately after leaving the university I went on a two-week company sprint in Madrid.
I met a lot of smart people and they even let me ramble on a YouTube stream.

# YouTube appearance

A few days into the Madrid sprint I was told that the technical authors would
be live-streaming on YouTube.
I fought the instinct that this was too-much-too-soon and ended up making my
first YouTube appearance since awkwardly talking about my PhD [over a decade ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvLCX4-xX0A).

What's really nice about [the chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWG-RekGkjo&t=1732s) is all the different paths that were taken
to the technical author role.
There's people with backgrounds in literature, mathematics, linguistics and
_even_ food science.
Everyone is really open about their own journey and it's great.

# Lots of new music

I'm making too much music to spam this site with regular updates.
I [posted](https://edibotopic.com/blog/doing/newly-sincere/) about Rurality, Punctums and Newly Sincere.
Since then I released [Rosacea](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/album/rosacea) and [Indirection](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/album/indirection).
Indirection takes the best songs from pseudonymously-released music
that I made at the end of last year.
I've had to mostly abandon that [pseudonym](https://edibotopic.com/blog/explaining/pseudonym-on-code-forge/) as I simply had too
many static sites to manage once I started the new job.
Rosacea is kind of atmospheric with a consistent mood while Indirection is an eclectic mix of nostalgic snippets.
Almost nobody has listened to either but I really like them anyway!
