Recently I encountered the concept of a "porogen" for the first time.
It is an approach to forming pores in a solid medium that I have since
seen applied in a variety of areas, including membrane fabrication,
tissue engineering and food science.

Everyday physical objects often consist of a solid matrix in which
pores are embedded.
The porous nature of these materials can have a big impact on how well they
function. 
A sponge can be filled with water because of its network of pores.
The porosity of wine corks allows them to be compressed
into a narrow glass channel where the cork expands to form a seal.
Many foods, like cakes, breads and meringues, owe some of their 
characteristic texture to the presence of thousands of tiny pores.
It's useful then to know how to make such porous materials in a
variety of contexts.

[In a paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jchemed.6b00776) 
in the *Journal of Chemical Education* a simple method was proposed to fabricate membranes.
Membranes are semi-permeable — they allow the passage of some particles
but not others — by virtue of their pores.
Membrane technology is used in a vast number of applications, including the
cleaning of water.
To create a membrane the scientist used a polymer solution that formed a 
gel (cellulose acetate and glycerol) and some insoluble particles that 
were embedded in the gel.
Once the gel was formed the embedded particles could be dissolved and leached
out of the gel, leaving only pores behind.
The particles were made of calcium carbonate, which is soluble in acid, so
washing the gel with acid was sufficient to create the porous
membrane.
The method was developed for an undergraduate teaching laboratory and it
definitely sounds like a cost-effective approach, as pre-fabricated
membranes can be expensive (*from experience*).

While the author did not use the term "porogen leaching", such a
process is typically described this way in other fields, specifically
tissue engineering.
Biological cells can be grown into specific biological forms to 
repair or replace damaged tissues.
Engineering these tissues usually requires a scaffold on which the
cells can grow.
Often a base material, such as a polymer, is mixed with a "porogen"
that acts as a template for generating pores in the solidified polymer.
The same approach [can be used in the preparation of cultured meat](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/13/6771).
Meat is itself a biological tissue and meat can also 
benefit from a porous scaffold on which to grow.

Using porogen technology does not necessarily require sophisticated
materials.
[One study used egg white and gelatin](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30174034/), commonly found in kitchens.
Egg white gels into a solid when heated — an irreversible process.
Gelatin solutions, however, form reversible gels when cooled that melt close to body temperature.
The researchers started by mixing egg white and gelatin.
Heating the mixture solidified the egg and cooling solidified the
gelatin.
When this gel was immersed in warm water the gelatin leached into the
water.
After the gel was dried it was found to be highly porous.
There are many potential food applications for such a material.
It could hold a large volume of liquid vegetable oil in an
effectively solid state, serving as a replacement for solid
animal fat in a diet low in saturated fatty acids.

I'm not certain about the origin of the term "porogen" but based on how a
*porogen* functions I assume the word is a blend of *pore* and *generator*.
Glancing at the literature in tissue engineering reveals some
other interesting language choices.
Particles used as porogens are frequently referred to as being
"sacrificial".
Presumably this relates to how they are sacrificed (to waste) in order
to generate pores.
They are also sometimes referred to as ["fugitive particles"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1751616120302848), perhaps
because a particle *escapes* the confines of the solid matrix to leave 
behind an empty cell, just like an escaped prisoner?
I'm less sure about that one.

It may not be immediately obvious how membrane fabrication, tissue engineering and 
cultured meats are connected, but *one* connecting factor is the usefulness of porogens.
