Recently I encountered the concept of a "porogen".
It is an approach to forming pores in a solid medium that 
has been applied in a variety of areas, including membrane fabrication,
tissue engineering and food technology.

Everyday physical objects often consist of a solid matrix in which
pores are embedded.
The porous nature of these materials can be important for how they
function. 
A sponge can absorb a large volume of water because of its porosity.
The pores in wine corks allow them to be compressed
in the neck of a wine bottle, wherein the cork expands to form a seal.
Many foods, like cakes, breads and meringues, partly owe their 
characteristic texture to the presence of thousands of tiny pores.

[In a paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jchemed.6b00776) 
in the *Journal of Chemical Education* a simple method was proposed to
fabricate membranes.
Membranes are semi-permeable — they allow the passage of some particles
but not others — due to the presence of pores of a specific size.
Membrane technology is used in a vast number of applications, including the
cleaning of water and the clarification of beer.
To create a membrane the scientist used a polymer solution that formed a 
gel (cellulose acetate and glycerol).
Insoluble particles — the _porogens_ — were embedded in the gel.
Once the gel was formed the porogens could be dissolved and leached
out of the gel, leaving pores in the space that they vacated.
The porogens were made of calcium carbonate, which is soluble in acid, so
acid could be used to selectively remove the porogens.

The method was developed for undergraduate teaching.
Materials like calcium carbonate and cellulose acetate are readily
available in laboratory cabinets, making this a convenient and 
cost-effective approach.
When I last purchased laboratory filtration cartridges they each
cost about 2000 euro.

While the author did not use the term "porogen leaching", such a process is
typically described this way in other fields, specifically tissue engineering.
Biological cells can be grown into specific biological forms to repair or
replace damaged tissues.
Engineering these tissues typically requires a _scaffold_ on which the
cells can grow.
Often a base material, such as a polymer, is mixed with a porogen
that acts as a template for generating pores in the solidified polymer.
The same approach
[can be used in the preparation of cultured meat](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/12/13/6771).

Egg white gels into a solid when heated — an irreversible process.
Gelatin solutions, however, form reversible gels when cooled that melt close to
body temperature.
[One study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30174034/) used these common kitchen ingredients
to explore the use of porogen technology in food applications.
The researchers started by mixing egg white and gelatin.
Heating the mixture solidified the egg and cooling solidified the gelatin.
When this gel was immersed in warm water the gelatin leached into the water.
After the gel was dried it was found to be highly porous.
There are many potential food applications for such a material.
It could hold a large volume of liquid vegetable oil in an
effectively solid state, serving as a replacement for solid
animal fat in a diet low in saturated fatty acids.

I'm not certain about the origin of the term "porogen" but based on how a
*porogen* functions I assume the word is a blend of _pore_ and _generator_.
in the literature, articles used as porogens are frequently referred to as
being "sacrificial"; presumably this relates to how they are sacrificed (to
waste) in order to generate pores.
They are also sometimes referred to as
["fugitive particles"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1751616120302848),
perhaps because a particle _escapes_ the confines of the solid matrix to leave 
behind an empty _cell_, like an escaped _prisoner_.

It may not be immediately obvious how membrane fabrication, tissue engineering
and cultured meats are connected, but _one_ connecting factor is the potential
usefulness of porogens.
