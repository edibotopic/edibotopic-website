As I get older, the sense I have of my own interests is becoming more simple. I
think that I mostly like _putting things together_.

Recently, I started putting images together to make collages, so I could put
the collages together with music, which was itself put together from samples.

## Workflow and tools

1. Find images ([public domain images](https://pdimagearchive.org/), [artvee](https://artvee.com/))
2. Cut them up and piece them together ([Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/))
3. Colourise and filter ([Pixelover](https://pixelover.io/))

## Leisure Sick

The first collage was for [Leisure Sick](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/album/leisure-sick).

This album has definite muzak vibes that evoke shopping malls
and your-doctor-recommends-these-cigarettes advertisements.

_Search terms: sixties; americana; lino; utopia; motel._

**Initial components:**

**The collage:**

**After applying some colour and filters:**

## Cop synths

The second collage was for [Cop Synths](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/album/cop-synths).

This sounds like a soundtrack to a lost eighties action movie, with corrupt cops
and over-the-top criminality.

_Search terms: cops; crime; sirens; mystery; lurk; curtain._

I also used the flamingo that didn't fit in the previous collage.

## Formal garden

The last collage was for [Formal
Garden](https://curtsyrehearsed.bandcamp.com/album/formal-garden), which I
consider to be "Zelda-like" in its sound, with the caveat that I have barely
played any Zelda.

_Search terms: grass; gardens; formal garden; expanse; walls; underwater._
