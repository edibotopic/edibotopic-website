# What Am I?

This [wiki](@/wiki/_index.md) is a place for short notes on concepts,
tools and works that I find interesting.
It is a "living document" and the entries will evolve over time.

If you find that something appears incomplete _that is normal_. I do
hope to continuously revise the entries but I also want to avoid them
becoming as bloated as a typical [blog](@/blog/_index.md) post.

I have just added the wiki to my site so it will take time to populate.
