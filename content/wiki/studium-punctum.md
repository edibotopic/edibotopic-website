# Studium and Punctum

These are Latin terms used by Roland Barthes in the book *Camera
Lucida* to analyse photography.

The *studium* is the general aspect of a photograph, usually relating
to its factual context.

The *punctum* is a particular quality that — in some sense —
**pierces** the observer.

Barthes gives an example of an old photo of a young man awaiting
execution for the attempted assassination of a French politician. 

Noting his clothes, the appearance of his cell and the chains
used to hold him, is to consider only the *studium*. 

There is also the **double death** of this figure, in that he
*has died already* (historically) and yet *is about to die* (in the
photo).
This would be to consider the *punctum*.

It might be argued that great artists (and great critics) are experts
in capturing such piercing qualities.
