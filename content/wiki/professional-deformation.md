# Professional Distortion

A tendency to have our worldview shaped by our profession,
even when the resultant beliefs and justifications may be
inappropriate to the matter at hand.

The term has its origins in the medical diagnosis of
_physical deformations_ associated with specific kinds
of labour.

Professional distortion may be observed in experts, due to 
the intense focus required by their discipline, the self-efficacy
gained through their accomplishments and the pressure on those
with expertise to not extend themselves beyond their discipline.

All problems and puzzles will then be viewed in a haze of metaphors
borrowed from their narrow professional context.
These become _epistemological obstacles_ that actively stifle
progress towards solving the problem.

This circumstance is not solely due to the arrogance of experts but
also the impossible position in which they are placed by society.

An expert must still exist in a varied world and respond to it daily.
Admonishing them for going beyond their expertise may simply
entrench them in narrow mental models.
This increases the likelihood that they will misapply those
mental models or simply disengage from societal discourse altogether.

The inability of specialised individuals to speak
on general matters may lead to an
[expert-citizen paradox](@/wiki/expert-citizen-paradox.md),
in which democracies that foster specialisation are populated
with expert-citizens inhibited in their democratic
participation.

Doing a PhD or a trade is not just an act of becoming an expert,
it is also a process of learning how expertise is developed.

Confronted with a new problem, an expert should be equipped to
understand what it takes to develop the relevant expertise.
They may be humbled and revert to their daily tasks, be
encouraged to seek that new knowledge or recognise those
around them who are better placed to offer solutions.
