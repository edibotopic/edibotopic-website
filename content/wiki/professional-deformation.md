# Professional Distortion

A tendency to have our worldview shaped by our profession,
even when the resultant beliefs and justifications may be
inappropriate to the matters at hand.

In an argument, a researcher accuses their partner of
not fulfilling the standards of rigour that they would
expect of a collaborator.

During a friendly discussion about creating personal websites,
a scholar of Foucault raises the spectre of the Panopticon,
and suggests that to exist on the internet is to engage in
a collective process of self-discipline.

Giving relationship advice, a painter-decorator comments that any
relationship needs a "fresh coat" every few years and that it is 
important to cover everything so that your surroundings don't get
damaged.

Having just being handed a freshly-cooked meal, a food scientist
looks at the cook and smugly comments "You know, I could explain
to you what just happened in that kitchen of yours".

Professional distoration may be less obvious and more insidious
than the contrived examples above.
For example, a passionate reader of fiction may become unable to
enjoy reading a book after studying to become an engineer, where
they have been drilled in the art of technical documentation.
