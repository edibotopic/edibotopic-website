# Expert-Citizen Paradox

In a democratic society people are broadly encouraged
to participate in a free exchange of ideas.

Within reason, there is no apparent impediment to an individual
expressing views on a variety of issues affecting society
at a given time.

As someone develops a degree of specialisation, however,
they may find they have a diminished capacity to engage
in popular or political discourse.

- An executive may be reminded of the consequences of damaging
their company's reputation.

- A scientist may be advised that their particular expertise only
allows them to speak on a narrow set of topics.

- A professional may be referred to a code-of-conduct that explicitly
disallows speech of a certain kind.

- An athlete may be told to "shut up and dribble".

Specialism or expertise becomes a kind of baggage, affecting one's
ability to comment privately and publicly on matters of societal importance.
Rather than constraining themselves to their domain, the individual may undergo
a [professional distortion](@/wiki/professional-deformation.md) in which aspects
of reality are filtered inappropriately through the lens of their work. 

Most industrialised democracies emphasise specialisation among their citizens.
If the resultant specialists are constrained in their speech, conditions of 
inhibited democratic discourse may arise.

This compels us to question what is lost when the lives
of citizens are shaped so completely by the nature of
their specialisms, and explore the general characteristics 
shared by processes of mastery, rather than their particular
outputs.
