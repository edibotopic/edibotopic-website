# Misdirected Science

A phenomenon in contemporary science in which scientists
engage in projects motivated by a scientific idea or hypothesis
that goes untested or unchallenged.

Often the original idea is interesting though unlikely, but has
attracted significant attention among non-scientists, resulting
in an abundant amount of funding being made available for research
in the area.

If the original idea is subsequently confirmed to be false, then the
entire edifice constructed around it will collapse, possibly
contributing to skepticism being directed towards science itself.
