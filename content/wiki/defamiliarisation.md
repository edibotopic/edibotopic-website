# Defamiliarisation

A process by which a familiar object is rendered as strange,
compelling us to reconsider the mundane anew.

Proposed as a primary function of art by the Russian theorist 
and critic 
[Viktor Shklovsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Shklovsky) 
in his essay
[Art as Device](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/currentstudents/undergraduate/modules/fulllist/first/en122/lecturelist2017-18/art_as_device_2015.pdf)

Alternative terminology includes *ostranenie* or *estrangement*.

The concept could be extended beyond the domain of art.
For example, encountering a
[systematic explanation](@/wiki/systemism.md)
of some everyday thing can cause defamiliarisation.
We still retain the capacity to observe that thing as
usual, but may also experience it an enriched way.
