# Systemism

An epistemological approach to knowledge that
recognises the necessity of moving between
parts and wholes.

Encompasses two kinds of *reduction*:

- Macro-reduction: from parts to wholes
- Micro-reduction: from wholes to parts

Having observed some interesting phenomenon in the world
there is an attempt to identify the mechanism that caused it.
This is a micro-reduction.
Equipped with this new understanding a model of the phenomenon
can be constructed.
This is a macro-reduction.

Crucially, the initial naive observation — a human experience — is
not destroyed or undermined in this process.
It may remain sufficient for many people, and may be enriched for
those who have obtained the new knowledge.
This is reminiscent of the process of
[defamiliarisation](@/wiki/defamiliarisation.md).

Dissatisfaction with *reductionism* can often lead to calls for a
[holistic turn](@/wiki/holistic-turn.md) that emphasises the *whole*.
An alternative shift towards *systemism* avoids the superficiality
and anti-intellectualism characteristic of holism.
