AI-based essay generators emerge and people begin to use them. Somewhere, an entrepreneur dreams of proctor drones monitoring online exams. What if many students <em>don’t want to plagiarise</em>, but they simply <em>do not know how</em> to write with originality? Maybe plagiarism is just a symptom of inadequate preparation rather than generational laziness or an emerging digital dystopia. Here I consider the particular case of science education.</p>\n<h2 id=\"these-are-the-facts\" tabindex=\"-1\">These are The Facts <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#these-are-the-facts\">\n                  <span class=\"direct-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</span>\n                    </a></h2>\n<p>In their first year at university students in a typical science degree are confronted with a bewildering array of <em>facts</em>. A student in a given discipline might be expected to develop a foundational knowledge in chemistry, physics and biology by the end of their first year. They are mostly taught about <em>what is known</em>: <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>x</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">x</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">x</span></span></span></span> is a fact, <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>y</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">y</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em;\">y</span></span></span></span> is a law, <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>z</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">z</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.04398em;\">z</span></span></span></span> is a method, and so on.</p>\n<p>When learning what it means <em>to do science</em> students learn primarily through group teaching labs. Here they are given recipes to prepare chemicals and instructions outlining the precise steps to follow. Increasingly, their scientific results must be written up according to a rigid <em>template</em>. Marks are awarded according to rubric that establishes in advance what what it means for an answer to be correct.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mind-numbing-strategies\" tabindex=\"-1\">Mind-numbing Strategies <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#mind-numbing-strategies\">\n                  <span class=\"direct-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</span>\n                    </a></h2>\n<p>The student at this point might be forgiven for assuming that science consists of reading procedures, reciting facts and following instructions. More cynical academics might even argue that this is true for those (majority of) scientists who subsequently find themselves with a career in industry. If some boss will one day give them precise instructions in how to do their job then their working life will resemble a template too.</p>\n<p>At times something <em>extra</em> is asked of the student, however. They might need to write essays or — more commonly — <em>literature reviews</em>. Literature reviews are useful for anyone seeking to understand a research area. If the popular notion of <em>doing your own research</em> meant <em>do your own literature review</em> we might be in a better place as a society. A <em>good</em> review is not merely a summary of facts but an integration of those facts into a balanced whole. It is not just a set of established answers but a base from which to <em>ask new interesting questions</em>.</p>\n<p>A successful review then might allow us to <em>confirm</em> what is scientifically known, <em>integrate</em> ideas from different primary sources, and <em>design</em> new research programmes. Creativity is required to achieve these aims and to makes plans informed by this new knowledge. It is with this kind of project that students are warned most severely about plagiarism. Exhaustive tutorials are provided on how to appropriately cite and reference. Someone taps a finger on a scary policy document. Unfortunately, many students then come to view writing as — above all — an exercise in avoiding plagiarism. Mind-numbing strategies are adopted in response:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To get below 20% on the plagiarism detection software I need to copy and paste a sentence but then re-arrange it, change 3-4 words and repeat this until I hit the word limit</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The process barely resembles what we understand as <em>writing</em>, does not allow the student to develop their own ideas and results in an incoherent experience for the unfortunate reader. Yet, it might well be a rational and effective strategy if success is defined narrowly as the avoidance of a positive hit on the plagiarism detector. This leaves the academic with little recourse: the facts are <em>The Facts</em> after all, right?</p>\n<h2 id=\"templates-all-the-way-down\" tabindex=\"-1\">Templates All the Way Down <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#templates-all-the-way-down\">\n                  <span class=\"direct-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</span>\n                    </a></h2>\n<p>In some ways these students are set up for failure (as writers).</p>\n<p>They have been drilled in the <em>recall</em> of facts but at some point they are expected to be astute and original thinkers. They are motivated <em>negatively</em> by warnings to avoid infringements on academic etiquette rather than being motivated <em>positively</em> by the opportunity to do original work and ask interesting questions.</p>\n<p>Do <strong>not</strong> state opinions.</p>\n<p>Flowery writing is <strong>not</strong> appropriate.</p>\n<p>Plagiarism is <strong>not</strong> allowed.</p>\n<p>There are academics who think that these capacities are best developed at postgraduate level <em>once the foundations have been laid</em> (whatever that means). For them there is no <em>expectation</em> that an undergraduate might have an original insight. The notion that graduate-entry positions at companies are thought to involve merely <em>following orders</em> further disincentivises academics from exploring student creativity and innovation. Even if students in STEM pursue postgraduate work the projects themselves will typically have been conceived and funded by their prospective supervisor.</p>\n<p>It’s templates all the way down.</p>\n<h2 id=\"remote-revelations-and-syntax-games\" tabindex=\"-1\">Remote Revelations and Syntax Games <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#remote-revelations-and-syntax-games\">\n                  <span class=\"direct-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</span>\n                    </a></h2>\n<p>The issue of plagiarism was discussed with renewed <s>rigour</s> vigour when universities closed because of Covid-19. Students who would normally do exams under supervision in a physical location were now doing them online. In many cases exams that were traditionally closed-book were now open-book, as students referring to their notes could not be (easily) policed. What transpired was that a significant number of students copied answers directly from reference materials. This ignited debates about digital proctoring technology that could prevent students from copying materials or collaborating on answers. Plagiarism came to be associated in the minds of many academics as an inherent flaw of the online exam.</p>\n<p>From my discussions with students at the time I gathered that they often simply <em>did not know how to write with originality</em>. To paraphrase a common query from students: “if a fact is a fact, then how am I supposed to write it differently?”. Students are commonly advised to read and then rewrite “in their own words” but this is a fatally vague instruction. Essentially it means: re-state what you have read with all of the essential facts intact and a few small insertions and removals. This tends to result in butchered writing that contains the same <em>semantic content</em> as the original but with drastically reduced readability. It is arguably more an exercise in syntax than science, which asks:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How good are you at re-arranging words while maintaining the meaning of a sentence?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"does-plagiarism-exist-if-it-isn%E2%80%99t-detected%3F\" tabindex=\"-1\">Does Plagiarism Exist if it isn’t Detected? <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#does-plagiarism-exist-if-it-isn%E2%80%99t-detected%3F\">\n                  <span class=\"direct-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</span>\n                    </a></h3>\n<p>The students who were most frustrated during this period were those that had developed exam preparation techniques that previously sufficed but were now considered plagiarism. A popular exam preparation technique is to memorise large sections of class notes and readings. In an exam hall, the student then identifies the question where a memorised chunk would be most relevant and reproduces it as faithfully as possible on paper. If plagiarism is the repurposing of original content without reference to the source materials then this would appear to be plagiarism. However, it is not usually considered plagiarism. Why? I have heard three responses given by academics:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Answers written on paper are not put through a plagiarism detector</li>\n<li>At least the information was recalled in an exam scenario, which is a difficult feat</li>\n<li>Human memory is unreliable, so it is likely the plagiarism wasn’t perfect</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The first point makes judgements of plagiarism contingent on the ease-of-application of a confirming technology. It suggests that something does not exist unless it is measured. Thus, if we stopped screening electronic submissions for plagiarism then plagiarism would cease to exist. Problem solved.</p>\n<p>The second point places great value on memorisation, which is certainly a useful skill. Few would argue, however, that rote memorisation develops in-depth knowledge of an area (which <em>is</em> surely the purpose of a university education). Furthermore, if we are simply evaluating students on their ability to reproduce ideas on command we should discard the notion of plagiarism altogether, given the prevalence of electronic tools that can augment human memory in most life situations.</p>\n<p>The third point seems to debase the notion of “originality”. We might expect that university prepares students to think originally with the <em>autonomous and intentional</em> application of reason. On this account, however, students are rewarded for imperfect memorisation that is muddled by <em>randomness and noise</em>. Students might be <em>original sometimes</em> but <em>always only by accident</em>.</p>\n<p>The students who normally patched together chunks of material in memory to be recalled later in an exam hall were now patching the same chunks together in a file that could be copied during an online exam. In terms of how these students prepared for the exams and how their answers were composed there was little material difference. As a matter of policy, however, one was plagiarism and the other was not.</p>\n<h2 id=\"distracted-by-spectres\" tabindex=\"-1\">Distracted by Spectres <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#distracted-by-spectres\">\n                  <span class=\"direct-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</span>\n                    </a></h2>\n<p>Subsequently there was a push to return to exams in physical exam halls, on the basis that this led to “better and fairer” exams. In reality, this likely reintroduced the tendency among many students to achieve astonishing feats of memorisation when plagiarising text under the watchful eye of invigilators.</p>\n<p>Plagiarism and its avoidance is evidently an important issue for academics but there is no clear conception of what constitutes plagiarism, why it is an intellectual vice or how students can be best prepared to avoid the practice. This seems especially true in STEM fields, where the art of writing well is frequently devalued and many of the solutions enacted by academics merely function to disguise or evade the problem. For example, if students are plagiarising in their essays then essays might be replaced by multiple choice questions where students do not have to formulate their own thoughts. If online exams have high amounts of plagiarism then they might be moved to an exam hall where the act of plagiarism becomes an impressive memory trick.</p>\n<p>The greatest tragedy in all of this is that generations of scientists are graduating without the instinct or ability to write. I expect that those of us who work in academia will continue to be distracted by new techno-dystopian spectres, like AI-generated student essays, when we might be best served addressing the age-old problem of teaching students that writing is a valuable activity. For science undergraduates, writing has become an intricate act of performing knowledge according to academic conventions rather than a useful method of developing one’s own ideas. As Paul Graham wrote in <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/essay.html\">The Age of the Essay</a>, to write an <em>essay</em> originally meant <em>to try</em> or <em>to attempt</em> (to figure something out). Such freedom of exploration is not facilitated within the confines of rigid templates and rubrics.</p>\n<p>One of the challenges in persuading students of the value of writing in the academic style is that it is not valued outside of academia. Most students will not become academic researchers and will therefore not need to satisfy the expectations of editors and peer-reviewers. In a research and development role in industry a graduate might be expected to write a literature review but it will not undergo a plagiarism check and is very unlikely to be submitted for publication.<br>\nPlagiarism norms reflect the public and communal nature of scholarly work but — as legal scholar Brian Frye <a href=\"https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=659113087090031103002099105071071095007085007037003090100005000104097069091127067102026056048010010036110094098031094087118012104006091005020064009087030118075087090016005101007009110029066115100029123006089078011010090117031123002117074015081002026&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;INDEX=TRUE\">has pointed out</a> — most student work is evaluated by an academic within the context of a classroom (it is not a public work). There is therefore an apparent disconnect between what motivates the standards for academic plagiarism and the students who must act in accordance with those standards.</p>\n<h1 id=\"appendix%3A-searching-for-alternative-models-to-think-about-plagiarism-and-originality\" tabindex=\"-1\">Appendix: Searching for Alternative Models to Think About Plagiarism and Originality <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#appendix%3A-searching-for-alternative-models-to-think-about-plagiarism-and-originality\">\n                  <span class=\"direct-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</span>\n                    </a></h1>\n<p>To help students to think critically about the rights and wrongs of plagiarism we might need to provide them with alternative models and case-studies, or at least something other than a <a href=\"https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=659113087090031103002099105071071095007085007037003090100005000104097069091127067102026056048010010036110094098031094087118012104006091005020064009087030118075087090016005101007009110029066115100029123006089078011010090117031123002117074015081002026&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;INDEX=TRUE\">vaguely-written but extremely consequential</a> academic dishonesty policy document. Art, music and design are replete with examples that are less opaque than academia and definitely more immediately thought-provoking.</p>\n<p>Most people would agree that directly copying a song from another artist and profiting from that copy is morally wrong — the difficulty with applying this model to science is that established scientific facts are taken to be “fixed” in their correct form, which makes it difficult to imagine an alternative means for their expression. The important point for students here is probably that not all scientific statements are statements of established fact; for example, most research papers offer — at most — tentative conclusions and recommendations based on limited data.</p>\n<p>The act/art of sampling is more of a contested issue than direct reproduction and in some jurisdictions (e.g., the US) <a href=\"https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/music-and-the-arts/899396/drake39s-sampling-is-a-fair-use\">may hinge on the concept of <em>transformative use</em></a>. There have been many famous cases of musicians — especially in hip-hop — being sued for sampling music, even when the song is a distinct creation on its face. This legal threat has led to a chilling effect, with many artists now resorting to <em>interpolation</em> rather than sampling. In this way, an original work is re-performed rather than re-produced. A music student might well be praised for interpolating a melody on their instrument and incorporating it into an otherwise original composition; however, to some degree that student is being assessed on their mastery as an instrumentalist and composer. It is less clear to what extent a scientist is a scientist insofar as they can recite and compose.</p>\n<p>I am reminded also of the phenomenon of <a href=\"https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/misheard-song-lyrics-6787\">mondegreens</a>, where a lyric, poem or quote is mis-read/heard or misinterpreted, yielding an original result — this is maybe the most likely route to originality for the scientific novice who is bewildered by a learned professor. Unfortunately, while a misinterpreted poem might lead to an interesting phrase, a misinterpreted scientific fact is likely to yield a falsity. This is perhaps reminiscent of the situation of the student in the exam hall, who interpolates source material and introduces new imperfections in the process.</p>\n<p>Lastly, there is the relatively new concept of the <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameDemake\">demake</a>, which is a remake of an original work within significant constraints. For example, a 3D videogame produced with a multi-million budget and a team of hundreds that is designed to run on the latest hardware will be demade into a 2D game by one person so that it runs on hardware from the 1980s. The student — who doesn’t have a personal laboratory or a team of researchers — operates within constraints that the academic scientist does not. A question then is: how can the student produce something original from within their definite constraints.</p>\n<p>The search continues…</p>\n<h1 id=\"links\" tabindex=\"-1\">Links <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#links\">\n                  <span class=\"direct-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</span>\n                    </a></h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/essay.html\">Paul Graham’s blog on the essay</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmr5Qrf_Vn8\">Podcast on plagiarism with Brian Frye</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3462144\">Paper on plagiarism by Brian Frye</a></p>\n"

      "content_html": "<style>\n  p>img {\n    margin: auto;\n  }\n</style>\n<p>Many food processes are designed to either promote <em>or</em> prevent the physical separation of particles from liquids. The behaviour governing such separation phenomena is described using an equation known as Stoke’s Law. Students of food science are familiar with this equation, although it is commonly misunderstood. Technical fixes for the physical instabilities in liquid foods are simple and long-standing, yet are sometimes mistrusted by the public. This short post discusses this equation and a simple interactive animation for developing intuition around the phenomena it describes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"animating-stoke%E2%80%99s-law\" tabindex=\"-1\">Animating Stoke’s Law <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#animating-stoke%E2%80%99s-law\">\n                  <span class=\"direct-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</span>\n                    </a></h2>\n<div style=\"height:100%; width:100%\">\n<iframe src=\"https://edibotopic.github.io/stokes-law\"\n    frameborder=\"0\"\n    overflow-y=\"scroll\" !important\n    scrolling=\"yes\"\n    width=\"100%\"\n    height=\"400vh\"\n    >\n</iframe>\n<div>\n<p><em><strong>Fig. 1.</strong> Interactive animation demonstrating Stoke’s Law.

In food science it is invoked for a variety of purposes. One of the most simple techniques for measuring a liquid’s viscosity involves using Stoke’s Law to estimate the value from the rate at which a ball falls through the liquid. The equation is also used to identify the key parameters that influence how a group of particles fall or rise due to gravity, which can be used to develop strategies to make it happen quicker or slower.

when “homogenised” is found on a product label or “guar gum” in an ingredients list. Homogenisation is simply a way of physically reducing the size of particles. As the particle diameter value (<span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>D</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">D</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.68333em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.02778em;\">D</span></span></span></span>) in Stoke’s Law is raised to the power of <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.64444em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">2</span></span></span></span> it has a significant influence on separation speed. Guar gum is one of a variety of food ingredients that has a purely <em>techno-functional</em> role, which typically involves increasing viscosity (<span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>μ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\mu</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">μ</span></span></span></span>) so that friction slows particles down as they move through the liquid. Sometimes it might be desirable to promote instability, such as when whole milk is centrifuged to create skim milk and cream, replacing the acceleration due to gravity (<span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>g</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">g</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em;\">g</span></span></span></span>) with that due to centrifugal force (<span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><msup><mi>ω</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mi>r</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\omega ^2 r</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.8141079999999999em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\"><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.03588em;\">ω</span><span class=\"msupsub\"><span class=\"vlist-t\"><span class=\"vlist-r\"><span class=\"vlist\" style=\"height:0.8141079999999999em;\"><span style=\"top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;\"><span class=\"pstrut\" style=\"height:2.7em;\"></span><span class=\"sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight\"><span class=\"mord mtight\">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\" style=\"margin-right:0.02778em;\">r</span></span></span></span>). These factors become more obvious if you play around with the <em>particle diameter</em> and <em>solvent viscosity</em> sliders in the animation. Try the other sliders and you might find some other interesting effects.</p>\n<h2 id=\"intuition%2C-education-%26-commerce\" tabindex=\"-1\">Intuition, Education &amp; Commerce <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#intuition%2C-education-%26-commerce\">\n                  <span class=\"direct-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</span>\n                    </a></h2>\n<p>Most of us have a good intuition for these phenomena in a non-food context. We expect large stones to sink faster than small pebbles. We know that the air pockets in a wine bottle cork means that it will tend to float on water. In food, the particles involved are often microscopic, making the behavior less <em>salient</em>. Showing a static photograph of particles on a microscope slide does not give us a feel for the dynamics involved. If we are uncomfortable with equations then the mathematics of Stoke’s Law might not help. That’s why I developed a simple simulation that allows students to manipulate all of the major variables using sliders. I hope this simple “virtual experiment” can improve the intuition of students for the phenomena but also the equation that helps explain them.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/img/cream_40X_mod.jpg\" alt=\"Micrograph of shaving cream\" title=\"micrograph of cream\"> <em><strong>Fig. 2.</strong> Micrograph of cream showing its emulsion structure. As the oil droplets are less dense than the water surrounding them they tend to float (credit: edibotopic).</em></p>\n<p>In recent years it has become more common for companies to avoid homogenising their products and to stop adding stabilising ingredients. This is not because of any demonstrable health benefit but rather because these products can be marketed as being “more natural”. This is an interesting case of a technological decision (to employ stabilising technology) being justified on the basis of a metaphysical judgement (that technologies have degrees of naturalness) with real business consequences (there is a market for “natural” foods). In any case, whether we buy a destablised smoothie at a health food store or homogenised milk from the supermarket, we can understand both using Stoke’s law.</p>\n"

      "content_html": "<style>\n  p>img {\n    margin: auto;\n  }\n</style>\n<p>I made a website when my academic job began to require more online teaching. The idea was to craft a space for exploring my personal and scholarly interests in a more integrated and informal way. Under time pressure, with little programming experience and a minimal amount of research, I chose <em>WordPress</em> as a publishing platform. This choice made it quick and easy to get a functioning site up-and-running, but creating the content soon became a chore. In parallel, I became a more proficient user of GitHub. For every incomplete blog post there was a new software project in a GitHub repository. For these and other reasons I have decided to migrate the website to GitHub. This post serves to outline my motivations and get this blog started.</p>\n<!-- TODO add links -->\n<h3 id=\"why-a-website%3F\" tabindex=\"-1\"><strong>Why a Website?</strong> <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#why-a-website%3F\">\n                  <span class=\"direct-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</span>\n                    </a></h3>\n<p>I developed a <em>somewhat</em> undeserved reputation as a “tech person” among my university colleagues during the era of Covid lockdowns. Admittedly, it was a period of frantic digital exploration. I sunk countless hours into music, programming and 3D design, among other activities. This was partially motivated by a sense of deep panic: having previously been an <em>occasionally</em> boring lecturer in some of my in-person classes, how could I now avoid giving boring online lectures? The blurry ambition was to model myself on the content creators that I had come to recognise as <em>effective</em> teachers (at least for me <em>personally</em>). There were plans for Youtube videos, personal blogs, bespoke soundtracks, software tools for teaching and a food-themed podcast. <em>Some</em> of these things materialised, and of those that <em>did</em> the website was probably the least successful.</p>\n<p>The original <a href=\"https://edibotopic.com\">edibotopic.com</a> — in some way — was an attempt to (re)integrate aspects of my own personality that had been cut adrift during the intense and specialised work characteristic of early-stage academia. My pre-academic life was defined mostly by writing <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo>+</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">+</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.66666em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">+</span></span></span></span> music (creatively) and sport <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mo>+</mo></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">+</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.66666em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;\"></span><span class=\"mord\">+</span></span></span></span> gaming (casually). If the creative projects were materially <em>unsuccessful</em> and the casual hobbies pleasant <em>distractions</em> they were still rewarding. During the initial years in my academic position (<em>in food science</em>) I earned a philosophy degree — much to the confusion of my colleagues — adding another node in my web of interests. I believe there are many productive and enlightening connections to be made between ideas across different domains of human knowledge, and I needed a place to explore these connections when the structures of academia did not make that possible.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bad-friction\" tabindex=\"-1\"><strong>Bad Friction</strong> <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#bad-friction\">\n                  <span class=\"direct-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</span>\n                    </a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org\">WordPress</a> is often recommended to beginners who want to make a website. It has a lot to offer. Choose a name, choose a theme and you’re on your way. There is a large ecosystem of <strong>plugins</strong>, which is also very attractive. For example, I was exploring the <a href=\"https://www.babylonjs.com/\">Babylon.js</a> game engine for making 3D content for the web and WordPress had a plugin for displaying those scenes. I thought that people might comment on my blog posts and there was a plugin for handling those user interactions. <em>What if someone wanted to make a donation</em> I thought and — sure enough — there was a plugin for that too.</p>\n<p>Later, I began to find these plugins more troublesome for a few reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Some of the features these plugins add are relatively trivial to implement in a standard website, <em>if</em> you know what you’re doing. How they often seem to function on WordPress is overcoming the constraints imposed by WordPress itself. Adding interactivity (through scripts) or styling (through CSS) is routine practice when tweaking a website but it is decidedly <em>awkward</em> on WordPress. Plugins overcome this awkwardness but at a cost.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Plugins often reduce site performance. Say you want to add support for a photo gallery. As a beginner, you might find some code samples online where this feature is implemented in a few lines of JavaScript and CSS. WordPress, however, makes it difficult to add the necessary code. So, someone recommends a gallery plugin, which you then install. Several weeks later you notice a dip in site performance. The common practice at this point is to uninstall each plugin one-by-one to identify the root cause. Even if this time-consuming, iterative process leads you to identify the culprit you are then left with the hard decision of whether to cull the offending plugin(s) to benefit performance, or sacrifice that performance for the desired functionality.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The plugin ecosystem is very much a <em>marketplace</em>. You will be surprised to find that seemingly basic features are behind a paywall. You will be prompted for reviews. Your choice to stop using a plugin will be queried. The creators of these plugins are entitled to seek feedback and remuneration for their efforts but if you are using multiple plugins this process can add unnecessary friction to the simple act of writing a blog post.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Many of the plugins that are attractive may not be necessary for meagre use-cases like my own. Writing blogs about niche academic topics was unlikely to attract donations. People were probably not going to fall in love having first met each other in the comments section of one of my blog posts. The ease with which you can add functionalities like these ones can very easily lead to you overpowering your website.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The answer to these problems is often simply to “use less plugins”, but if the diversity and easy-implementation of plugins were what attracted you in the first place then a major benefit of the platform seems to be undermined by this line of reasoning.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All this I know with the benefit of hindsight. The “trivial implementations” I refer to were not trivial for me <em>at the time</em>. I did not know what functionality my site would require. In retrospect, I could only ever have started with a tool like WordPress and if I had more complex requirements (e-commerce) then maybe I never would have left. I had chosen <code>wordpress.org</code> as opposed to <code>wordpress.com</code> as the former seemed to offer more immediate possibilities for customisation. This required me to <strong>pay for web hosting</strong>. Similar functionality can be accessed in the <code>.com</code> option if you enter one of <a href=\"http://WordPress.com\">WordPress.com</a>’s <strong>paid tiers</strong>. While I was <em>paying</em> a significant amount of money for a website that was painful to customise and maintain, my <a href=\"https://github.com/edibotopic\">GitHub profile</a> swelled with freely-hosted web applications.</p>\n<p>The alternative for <em>me-as-beginner</em> was building a site from scratch or using a static site generator. These options were beyond my skill-set at the time, or at least beyond my capacity to understand what I was directly manipulating when building the site. So I maintained my unproductive blog, which largely involved the drudgery of updating plugins to prevent security problems. At the same time I was increasingly productive with small software projects on GitHub. Creating these projects on GitHub was <em>more difficult</em> on its face (it involved actual coding), yet it was where I seemed to be making the most ground.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-decision-to-change\" tabindex=\"-1\"><strong>The Decision to Change</strong> <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#the-decision-to-change\">\n                  <span class=\"direct-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</span>\n                    </a></h3>\n<p>My personal grievances with WordPress came to head when I was writing my final blog post, which was a summary of some recent software projects.</p>\n<p>In the intervening years I had become a fan of editing plain text/markdown using (Neo)Vim as my text editor. I would then copy the text and paste it into the WordPress editor. Inevitably this would cause unforeseen formatting issues that would take a considerable amount of time to fix. I had enabled markdown editing in WordPress <em>via</em> a plugin but the post still came out jumbled. I had specific, enraging problems with adding a code block, a feature common to most markdown editors/previewers that looks like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token comment\">// code goes here</span><br><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> a <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><br><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> b <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">6</span><br><br>console<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>b <span class=\"token operator\">/</span> a<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><br><span class=\"token comment\">// returns 3</span></code></pre>\n<p>I ended up installing three different plugins before I found something that worked and the results <em>still</em> looked bad. Due to these and other issues, every time I sat down to write something there was a little bit of dread associated with the publishing stage. As writing is already difficult enough, the (bad) friction introduced by the WordPress editor was a problem.</p>\n<h3 id=\"good-friction\" tabindex=\"-1\"><strong>Good Friction</strong> <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#good-friction\">\n                  <span class=\"direct-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</span>\n                    </a></h3>\n<p>Plain text. The terminal. Text editors. Version control.</p>\n<p>Terms that are superficially bland but that are known to excite many programmers. Like most <em>non-programmers</em>, I was originally mystified as to why these were interesting or useful, not to mind <em>exciting</em>. I gradually came to understand their appeal, and I hope to discuss these topics in more depth in future posts. For now, it is enough to say that I greatly value the customisability and speed of a good text editor, as well as the structured and transparent nature of a version-controlled project. When creating material for a website I wanted to leverage these tools. Like <a href=\"https://noelle.dev/meta/about\">others before me</a> I decided to make the switch from WordPress to a static site generator.</p>\n<p>This website took longer to setup than if I was using WordPress. Like most static site generators the idea is simple: to take content written in markdown and convert it into web pages. The site is <em>static</em> as opposed to <em>dynamic</em> because I want to show all users the same content rather than tailor the site based on data from individual users — as a result, the static version of <a href=\"https://edibotopic.com\">edibotopic.com</a> is faster then the dynamic WordPress version and I am prevented from adding annoying/unnecessary features that “personalise” the user experience. Most of my interaction with the site should basically proceed as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Open a terminal</li>\n<li>Write <code>.md</code> file</li>\n<li>Run <code>npm run build</code></li>\n<li><code>Push</code> changes to GitHub</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The markdown is a straightforward way of formatting text:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-markdown\"><code class=\"language-markdown\"><span class=\"token title important\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">###</span> Good Friction</span><br><br>Plain text. The terminal...<br><br>Terms that are...<br><br><span class=\"token list punctuation\">1.</span> Open terminal<br><span class=\"token list punctuation\">2.</span> Write markdown...<br><br>The markdown is a straightforward way of formatting text:</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>build</code> process, however, involves multiple interacting parts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Site generator</strong>: eleventy</li>\n<li><strong>Bundler</strong>: Vite</li>\n<li><strong>Markdown parser</strong>: markdown-it</li>\n<li><strong>CSS tools/frameworks</strong>: tailwind, PostCSS</li>\n<li><strong>Package manager</strong>: NPM</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Besides obvious tasks like styling the website to my preferences, there were innumerable tiny problems to solve associated with these different parts.</p>\n<p>The original bundler had been deprecated so I had to migrate to Vite. List numbers/bullets were being rendered incorrectly and I needed to learn Tailwind configuration to fix them. Several issues were associated with outdated dependencies that needed to be updated or upgraded through <code>NPM</code>. My <em>production build</em> did not behave like my <em>development build</em> because of how GitHub handles relative paths.</p>\n<p>Even when addressing these issues took time the solution usually <em>made sense</em>, rather than being some <em>deus ex machina</em> in the form of a plugin. While I <em>do</em> use plugins on this site they are less abundant and often merely implement small adjustments to how an <code>.md</code> file is converted into <code>.html</code>.</p>\n<p>My major gripe with static site generators is how they appear <em>as a code base</em> to the uninitiated. In the other software projects I have worked on I like the idea that someone can look at the code and see a simple directory structure like so:</p>\n<pre><code>+--scripts\n+--styles\n+--index.html\n</code></pre>\n<p>Static site generators create relatively complex directory structures. In addition, different people use different JAM (JavaScript APIs Markup) <a href=\"https://jamstack.org/\">stacks</a>. While I use <a href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/\">Eleventy</a> another will use <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/\">Hugo</a>, with subtly different APIs, dependencies and directory structures in each case. If you like a feature of a static site and want to study it there can be a lot of detective work involved. From a pedagogical standpoint this is undesirable, especially if a prospective student is not already a web developer.</p>\n<p>Regardless, I needed something compact that I could manage and understand <em>if only in principle</em>. When something breaks it would be within my power to investigate and fix it, rather than endlessly searching forums for workarounds.</p>\n<p>While my instinct for colour schemes might not be perfect — you can be the judge — this site looks <em>at least as good</em> as the WordPress one to my eyes, and I am in more control of how that might change in the future.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-current-plan\" tabindex=\"-1\"><strong>The Current Plan</strong> <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"#the-current-plan\">\n                  <span class=\"direct-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\">#</span>\n                    </a></h3>\n<p>Many people have a difficulty with <em>starting writing</em>, while I have a difficulty <em>stopping writing</em>. I have a natural tendency to write articles that are long, verbose and that try to do too much.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Example 1</strong>: my final blog on the previous site, which attempted to summarise 6-7 software projects I had worked on. Of course, this could have simply been 6-7 shorter and more self-contained blog posts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Example 2</strong>: this very post.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Coming from academia, I am also a prodigious editor. An article requiring 5 or even 12 drafts is <em>normal</em> to me. This, however, is not sustainable when maintaining a “casual” blog. The whole idea here is to write more freely and fluently, even if a post ends up on <em>Hacker News</em> and its exacting users decry the state of internet writing.</p>\n<p>A major goal of mine with this site is to write more regularly but also more concisely, with this blog perhaps being a bad start in that respect! In addition, it will function as a reference for my recent and active projects in music, software and technology. Lastly, if my nascent multimedia projects (video, podcasting) come to fruition then I will incorporate them into this site.</p>\n<p>More soon 😉</p>\n"
