id=systemism>Systemism<a aria-label="Anchor link for: systemism" class=zola-anchor href=#systemism>#</a></h1><p>An epistemological approach to knowledge that recognises the necessity of moving between parts and wholes.<p>This encompasses two kinds of <em>reduction</em>:<ul><li>Macro-reduction: from parts to wholes<li>Micro-reduction: from wholes to parts</ul><p>Having observed some interesting phenomenon in the world there is an attempt to identify the mechanism that caused it. This is a micro-reduction. Equipped with this new understanding a model of the phenomenon can be constructed. This is a macro-reduction.<p>Crucially, the initial naive observation — a human experience — is not destroyed or undermined in this process. It may remain sufficient for many people, and may be enriched for those who have obtained the new knowledge. This is reminiscent of the process of <a href=https://edibotopic.com/notes/defamiliarisation/>defamiliarisation</a>.<p>Dissatisfaction with <em>reductionism</em> can often lead to calls for a <a href=https://edibotopic.com/notes/holistic-turn/>holistic turn</a> that emphasises the <em>whole</em>. An alternative shift towards <em>systemism</em> avoids the superficiality and anti-intellectualism characteristic of holism.<h1 id=the-basic-model>The Basic Model<a aria-label="Anchor link for: the-basic-model" class=zola-anchor href=#the-basic-model>#</a></h1><p>A basic model of systemism, outlined by <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Bunge>Mario Bunge</a> as an alternative to reductionism and holism, will here be outlined in brief.<p>Imagine you have made a <em>causal</em> observation of some kind. This could be that:<ul><li>A particular seasoning makes the dinner tastier<li>A function in some code makes the program crash<li>A joke makes the people around you uncomfortable</ul><p>These cause-effect relations are salient and apparent in your <em>immediate context</em>.<p>This is the <code>macro</code> level. It is at the top of our diagram and is signified by $A_0 \to B_0$:<p>$$\Huge { {{{A_0 \atop \downarrow} \atop A_1} {{\to \atop \ } \atop \to} {{B_0 \atop \uparrow} \atop B_1}} } $$<p>At the bottom there is also a causal relation $A_1 \to B_1$ occupying the <code>micro</code> level. The micro is not given or immediate. To access it may require deep thought, model building or the use of instruments.<p>Moving between the two levels — micro and macro — is characteristic of:<ol><li><strong>Analysis</strong>: determining the micro-level causes responsible for macro-level effects or outcomes<li><strong>Synthesis</strong>: creating macro-level effects or outcomes through manipulation of micro-level components</ol><p>The diagram above depicts an <em>analysis</em> of the <code>micro</code> causes of the <code>macro</code> event.<p>It is possible to restrict an investigation to a single level, as shown in cases of<ul><li><strong>Micro-reduction</strong>: "there is no society, only individuals"<li><strong>Macro-reduction</strong>: "our senses alone can guide healthy food choice"</ul><p>While the former is commonly referred to as "reductionism", in contra-distinction to the "holism" of the latter, both are related as being <em>kinds of reduction</em>, requiring a narrowing of perspective and a denial of systematic relations.<h2 id=epistemology-ontology-and-axiology>Epistemology, Ontology and Axiology<a aria-label="Anchor link for: epistemology-ontology-and-axiology" class=zola-anchor href=#epistemology-ontology-and-axiology>#</a></h2><p>The "macro" does not necessarily refer to a <strong>fixed, well-defined ontology</strong>. It depends on the context of an investigation. The elevated position of the macro in a diagram is also <strong>not a value judgement</strong>. It is a focal point from which an investigation can be initiated.<p>What delineates levels of analysis may be determined by a specific domain of inquiry, with many levels lying either side of the given <code>macro</code> level.<table><thead><tr><th>Domain<th>Micro<th>Macro<th>Mega<tbody><tr><td>Economics<td>Individuals<td>Groups<td>Societies<tr><td>Technology<td>Components<td>Sub-assemblies<td>Devices<tr><td>Software<td>Low-level code<td>High-level code<td>User interfaces</table><p>If there is an explanatory gap between two or more levels the ontological concept of "emergence" may be invoked. Here, events occur and seem to be related but the mechanism that relates them is not yet clear. Importantly, this does not mean that the mechanism will never be known. It is likely that the mechanism simply remains to be discovered.<p>In summary, there is sometimes a question of the form "what $x_1$ is the cause of $x_0$?":<p>$$x_1? \to x_0$$<p>The $x_0$ could be a scientific observation, a desirable state-of-affairs or a problem to fix at the <code>macro</code> level. Rather than presuming a mysterious <em>emergence</em> we proceed in two ways:<p>In <strong>analysis</strong> the causes at the micro-level are identified. For example, a specimen known to exhibit an effect of interest is scrutinised with special instruments. To explain why salt has an associated taste we might measure its chemical dissociation in saliva, which enables the transmission of signals to the brain. Salts may be observed to have different intensities of saltiness, prompting measurement of conductivity as the different salts dissolve into solution.<p>$$ \Huge {{Salt \atop \downarrow} \atop Na^+ } {{\to \atop \ } \atop \to} {{taste \atop \uparrow} \atop signal} $$<p>In <strong>synthesis</strong> the effect (or outcome) is generated under specific conditions. Inventing technology can help society make progress. Such progress is bolstered further when an invention has a concrete implementation as a product. This facilitates exposure to the market, which initiates mechanisms of feedback that can improve the implementation. Accelerating progress is not just about getting products to market, it's also about providing conditions in which people can be inventive and supporting feedback mechanisms to assist optimisation.<p>$$ \Huge {{Product \atop \uparrow} \atop Invent } {{\to \atop \ } \atop \to} {{Market \atop \downarrow} \atop Progress} $$<p>The appearance of emergent properties may highlight an inappropriate conceptual or methodological framing. For example, water can be interpreted on a strictly molecular basis as being composed of two kinds of elements existing in a certain relative proportion and structured by particular forces. This is the <code>micro</code> level. Yet at the macro level water has properties like viscosity and turbulence, which are difficult to predict based on strict appeals to molecular chemistry. For this reason scientific fields like rheology are oriented towards developing specific methodologies appropriate to a relatively <code>macro</code> level.<h2 id=kinds-of-reduction>Kinds of Reduction<a aria-label="Anchor link for: kinds-of-reduction" class=zola-anchor href=#kinds-of-reduction>#</a></h2><p>It is often mistakenly assumed that one level is superior or "more foundational" as a form of explanation. A scientist may reject sense experience altogether as imprecise and unreliable, despite its obvious utility and importance. A "layperson" may reject scientific facts as counter to their lived experience despite their capacity to empower.<p>These different levels, however, exhibit a productive inter-dependence. Science is often initiated after a surprise observation is made at the <code>macro</code> level. Subsequent discoveries at the <code>micro</code> level gradually become widely known, at which point they become "common knowledge".<blockquote class="callout note"><div class=icon><svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" height=20 width=20 xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg><path d="M12 22C6.47715 22 2 17.5228 2 12C2 6.47715 6.47715 2 12 2C17.5228 2 22 6.47715 22 12C22 17.5228 17.5228 22 12 22ZM12 20C16.4183 20 20 16.4183 20 12C20 7.58172 16.4183 4 12 4C7.58172 4 4 7.58172 4 12C4 16.4183 7.58172 20 12 20ZM11 7H13V9H11V7ZM11 11H13V17H11V11Z" fill=currentColor></path></svg></div><div class=content><p><strong>Feynman's artist friend</strong><p>The famous anecdote from Feynman about his artist friend who appreciates the beauty of a flower, but rejects its destruction by (micro)reductionist biological sciences, encapsulates this tension.<p>Feynman does not deny that a flower is beautiful and that he can experience that beauty.

There is huge inter-batch variation in colour, however, and a need to better control the process.<p>We have learned that a change in pH is critical for determining the final colour of the tea.
