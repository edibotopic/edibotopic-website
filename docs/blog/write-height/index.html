powerful software than this tool — <em>WriteHeight</em> — exists but their complexity often presents a significant barrier to newcomers. Based solely on heightmaps, WriteHeight only requires the user to upload or draw grayscale images. The 2D image is then converted into a 3D model that can be inspected or downloaded. This post explains the motivation behind WriteHeight, what it can do and why it still needs a lot of work.<p>Play around with <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://edibotopic.github.io/write-height/>WriteHeight</a> or <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://github.com/edibotopic/write-height>read the source code</a>.<h2 id=making-3d-easier>Making 3D Easier<a aria-label="Anchor link for: making-3d-easier" class=zola-anchor href=#making-3d-easier>#</a></h2><p>While not everyone self-identifies as an artist people still draw in a variety of contexts. I work mostly with scientists who — while not usually artistically-trained — routinely produce drawings in the form of flow diagrams and graphical abstracts. Whether generated on paper or on a screen, these drawings are an important method of thinking through our ideas and communicating them to others. Concepts can also be represented in 3D, but this traditionally requires a mastery of techniques like shading and perspective. Today, powerful (and free) software like <a href=https://edibotopic.com/blog/write-height/www.blender.com>Blender</a> allows the direct manipulation of models in 3D space, and there is an endless supply of online learning resources to get people started.<p>My initial forays into 3D were prompted by online teaching. The difficulty in the remote delivery of STEM content lies more with the laboratory practicals than the lectures, and I wanted to learn how to make interactive 3D versions of these labs. At the same time, I was involved in research projects on the 3D printing of food. Whether in the context of teaching or research, I found that scientists were reluctant to engage with 3D modelling. Research papers on topics like 3D food printing often give minimal attention to the design of a given model or the specific purpose of its structure. The apparent discomfort with 3D design is perhaps unsurprising, given that the transition from 2D to 3D introduces marked complexity. A 3D scene can require the management of new kinds of elements — like cameras and lights — that are not required when making a 2D image. Well-constructed scenes can look ugly if the lighting is wrong. A model may not render or print correctly if the topology is flawed. There are different paradigms of modelling, including the direct modelling approach favoured by digital artists and the parametric approach used by mechanical engineers. Blender is also a hybrid application — combining (at a minimum) a 3D modeller, animation suite, video editor and compositor — and this vast range of functionality is evident in its interface. Despite all these complexities, much can be learned about 3D modelling from adept teenagers with small YouTube channels.<p><img alt="UI of WriteHeight" title="UI of WriteHeight" src=/figs/writeHeightUI.png> <em>User interface of WriteHeight showing the 2D heightmap (top-left, inset) and the resultant 3D mesh (main).</em><p>For me, one of the most intuitive paths for transitioning from drawing in 2D to modelling in 3D is the <strong>heightmap</strong>. While this approach has its limitations, I think it is a good entry-point to 3D that can produce interesting results. A heightmap is simply a 2D greyscale image, with an x- and a y-axis. The relative lightness of pixels in that 2D image can be converted to vertex heights in a 3D model, yielding the third z-axis. Black pixels become the lowest regions in the model and white pixels the highest regions.<h2 id=existing-software>Existing Software<a aria-label="Anchor link for: existing-software" class=zola-anchor href=#existing-software>#</a></h2><p>Most software with 3D capabilities, including dedicated modellers like Blender and game engines like <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://unity.com/>Unity</a>, can generate models from heightmaps; however, if this is all that you want to achieve they are probably overkill.<p>A separate application is usually required to make the grayscale image that will be transformed into a 3D model. There are dedicated applications for generating heightmaps from real terrain elevation data, such as <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://tangrams.github.io/heightmapper/>Tangram Heightmapper</a>. Another approach is that of <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://archive.org/details/jsplacement-1.3.0-allplatforms_202108>JSplacement</a>, which generates random heightmaps from <em>greebles</em>, smaller grayscale parts that are arranged and combined into larger heightmaps. With a modern digital drawing app like <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://krita.org/en/>Krita</a> the range of possible heightmaps is only limited by your skill and imagination.<p>Ephtracy's <a href="https://ephtracy.github.io/index.html?page=aerialod" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Aerialod</a> is dedicated to the specific task of rendering 3D models from heightmaps and comes with a range of options to generate beautiful renders. Most of my initial heightmap experimentation started with Aerialod, due to its elegance and simplicity. However, I am now a Linux-user and at time-of-writing Aerialod is only available as a Windows-only download.<p>For my purposes, I wanted something that was:<ol><li>Dedicated to making 3D models from heightmaps<li>Accessible on any device (computer, tablet, phone)<li>Useable in a browser with no download required</ol><h2 id=writeheight>WriteHeight<a aria-label="Anchor link for: writeheight" class=zola-anchor href=#writeheight>#</a></h2><p>As an application WriteHeight is simple. It opens with a viewport showing a random 3D model, which can be inspected using mouse, touch or arrow keys. The corresponding 2D image from which the model was generated is shown inset. The 3D model is rendered using the <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://www.babylonjs.com/>babylon.js</a> game engine. Buttons are included below the viewport, one allows for the generation of further random models from a finite collection. Another allows a user to upload their own heightmap image, which will then be rendered into an inspectable 3D model. Models can then be downloaded in different formats, including <code>.stl</code> (good for 3D printing) and <code>.glb</code> (good for 3D rendering).<p>For convenience, two <em>very basic</em> tools are provided with WriteHeight to generate and download heightmaps. Clicking the <code>pencil</code> button opens a greyscale drawing tool — this reflects the initial goal of <strong>Write</strong>Height, which was to <em>write</em> heightmaps that could be converted into 3D. Clicking the <code>walking</code> button opens a random walk visualisation that algorithmically generates a grayscale image --- this reflects an ambition for WriteHeight to (eventually) offer a set of simple algorithms for the procedural design of 3D models.<h2 id=memory-problems>Memory Problems<a aria-label="Anchor link for: memory-problems" class=zola-anchor href=#memory-problems>#</a></h2><p>I am a self-taught programmer and try to learn by making projects. My academic job involves no programming and also leaves me with little time to actually write programs. While I would not say that <em>I am a programmer</em> it is the case that <em>I do programming</em>. In general, I find it more productive to focus on what I <em>do</em> rather than what I <em>am</em> when working on hard problems.<p>One of the things I like about programming as an activity is the immediacy of the feedback loop. It is satisfying to see a nice output like a rendered 3D object but finding bugs can also be a salient reminder that there is much left to learn. If the bug is in a live application then one is left with a constant aching reminder to figure it out.<p>I had encountered the concept of a <strong>memory leak</strong> in the abstract during my messy self-teaching process. It was difficult for me to appreciate why exactly I should care until it slapped me in the face while working on WriteHeight. This is a real issue with the current version and has compelled me to begin exploring the role of memory management in effective programming.<p>When the application is initially run everything works great. The performance is fast and the model can be downloaded in different formats. Load a second and third model, however, and problems arise. Each time a model is loaded the previous model <em>visually</em> disappears, which is the intended result; yet, the performance of the application also degrades slightly. Now if you click <code>download</code> you will get a copy of the visible model but also the previous models that have "disappeared". In other words, the previous models are no longer being rendered but still somehow <em>exist in memory</em>. Memory is leaked each time a new model is generated.<p>The application is written in JavaScript, which is infamous for enabling programmers to quickly make something interesting ("cool, a 3D model in the browser!") while causing themselves future pain ("I want them to download one model not eight!"). JavaScript is a <em>garbage-collected</em> language that is supposed to automatically handle the freeing of memory. In WriteHeight, when a model is created it will occupy some memory. Ideally, when I replace that model with a new one, the garbage collector will automatically reclaim memory from the first model. Clearly, this is not happening, and the models continue to occupy memory. For some reason the garbage collector is not effectively identifying the garbage that needs to be collected. For this to be fixed the functioning of the garbage collector needs to be interrogated and massaged, but garbage-collected languages do not make this easy.<p>Programming is replete with these painful and enlightening lessons.<p>I now plan to get more familiar with languages that facilitate <em>manual</em> memory management, to get a better intuition for how memory issues are prevented outside of the rarified context of web development. <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://github.com/edibotopic/sqong>Sqong</a> is a tiny project I made in one such language (<a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://odin-lang.org/>Odin</a>). It is just a modest clone of <a rel="nofollow noreferrer" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong>Pong</a>, which nonetheless provides the rare satisfaction of hearing my own mouth noises soundtrack the collision of a ball off walls and paddles. It has been quite therapeutic writing code for a small project without needing to think about how the application will run on different browsers and devices. It is almost certain that Sqong has issues that I am not aware of that I will soon learn from.<p>Most of my journey through programming to date has involved web-based projects. This has yielded some nice, shareable projects. I increasingly think — however — that my work could be improved with a stronger handle on fundamentals like memory management. That may require forgetting about the web as a target for a while.</article><footer><div class=copyright><p>© edibotopic | 2023</div></footer></main><aside class=blur><nav><ul><li><a class=h2 href=#making-3d-easier>Making 3D Easier</a><li><a class=h2 href=#existing-software>Existing Software</a><li><a class=h2 href=#writeheight>WriteHeight</a><li><a class=h2 href=#memory-problems>Memory Problems</a></ul></nav><button aria-label="back to top" id=back-to-top><svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" height=24 width=24 xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg><path d="M11.9997 10.8284L7.04996 15.7782L5.63574 14.364L11.9997 8L18.3637 14.364L16.9495 15.7782L11.9997 10.8284Z" fill=currentColor></path></svg></button></aside></div><script src=/js/lightense.min.js></script><script src=/js/main.js></script>
