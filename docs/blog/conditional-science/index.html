First, an extravagant claim is made by a researcher. Next, this encourages other researchers pursue a set of loosely-related questions that don't test the original claim. The interestingness or importance of these questions are then <em>conditional</em> on the truth of the initial, untested claim.</p><span id=continue-reading></span><p>A few years ago a scientist approached me about a potential collaboration. There had been a big fuss about a particular food product. Another scientist had claimed that this food product could be responsible for a wide range of medical issues affecting human populations.<p>Many years had passed since this claim was made and there was still little supporting evidence. The scientific justification for the claim had been roundly criticised by the scientific community. That the original scientist had since built a profitable company purporting to sell a "healthier" version of the product attracted some well-earned suspicion.<p>In my office, the scientist and I both shared the view that the original claim was likely bogus. They reminded me, however, that there was a lot of interest in this topic and that it could be the basis of a lucrative funding proposal. The scientist assured me that while the work would focus on the food product, none of the research would relate directly to the tricky question of its health effects.<p>Imagine<sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#1>1</a></sup> that the food product in question was claimed to be a major contributor to heart disease. <em>If that were true</em>, some healthier alternatives would need to be developed. We would then focus on the science of their flavour and texture, such that <em>in the event they were needed</em> people might find them tolerable to consume. This is a common strategy in food science because many food scientists do not have the expertise to study health effects. A product will attract interest and prestige because of its health effects (real or not) and food scientists will study everything but those health effects.<p>Funding proposals, press releases and lectures relating to such a project will then all start with the premise that the product under investigation has been claimed to be a major contributor to human disease, even if this claim is not to be tested.<p>Food science is an applied field. Even if the original claim was false it was certainly true that there was now a market interest in "healthier" versions of the product. As the market potential for these products existed there were companies who wanted to invest in their manufacture. To implement this technology effectively <em>good science</em> was required and so funding was made available by governments and corporations.<p>The average member of the public then got confronted with products that (prematurely) claimed to address their health issues. In parallel, there were press releases and newspaper articles about the legitimate science that was focused on these products. It is unsurprising then that many people started to buy these products and assume that they were important.<p>To the scientists involved there was somehow no conflict between thinking that the original health claim <strong>is probably bullshit</strong> and securing research funding on the basis that the health claim <strong>is probably not bullshit</strong>. For those who do acknowledge the conflict they might appeal to pragmatism/desperation ("I have to get my research funded somehow"), philosophy/misdirection ("Good science is found in the unlikeliest of places") or specialisation/ignorance ("Oh I'm not an expert in health so who is to know really").<p>Let's consider now why this might be a problem.<p>Other real problems of actual consequence exist and need to be solved. Given the existence of real problems that are known to affect people right now then these should be the focus of investment and research, not possible issues that can be reasonably assumed to not exist.<p>Public perception is also influenced by the rhetoric of science. If a technology is actively being marketed as important for health then scientific research that doesn't test or challenge this claim may lend legitimacy to the product, even if the science itself operates at the periphery of the original claim.<p>In popular discourse there is a skepticism about food and nutritional sciences. It is common to hear about corporations trying to get people addicted to their products or the failure of the entire scientific enterprise to tackle the complexity of food and diet. I think these criticisms are often grandiose and unfounded, frequently missing the important contributions that these sciences have made to society. However, I think that there is sometimes a cynicism and opportunism in how scientists choose their projects, especially when the scientific problems relate to a technology of potential commercial value. Food products making extraordinary claims come and go by the dozen. Some eventually shrink their claims in response to regulatory scrutiny<sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#2>2</a></sup>. In the intervening period — which can span decades — scientists help shape the perception of technology, among students, funders and the public. They therefore have some responsibility for considering the impact of their choices, in terms of public understanding of science, the effective use of resources and the perceived efficacy of their discipline<sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#3>3</a></sup>.<p>I explained to the scientist<sup class=footnote-reference><a href=#3>3</a></sup> that I was not interested. They later received funding for the project. It was probably a bad career move on my part but I am at peace with my decision.<div class=footnote-definition id=1><sup class=footnote-definition-label>1</sup><p>I do not want to focus on the product itself but rather the general issue it represents.</div><div class=footnote-definition id=2><sup class=footnote-definition-label>2</sup><p>A claim to treat a disease may become a promise of more "comfort".</div><div class=footnote-definition id=3><sup class=footnote-definition-label>3</sup><p>Who is a lovely person and great scientists by the way.</div></article><footer><div class=copyright><p>© edibotopic | 2023</div></footer></main><aside class=blur><button aria-label="back to top" id=back-to-top><svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" height=24 width=24 xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg><path d="M11.9997 10.8284L7.04996 15.7782L5.63574 14.364L11.9997 8L18.3637 14.364L16.9495 15.7782L11.9997 10.8284Z" fill=currentColor></path></svg></button></aside></div><script src=/js/lightense.min.js></script><script src=/js/main.js></script>
